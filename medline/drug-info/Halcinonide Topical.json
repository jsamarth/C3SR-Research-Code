It is usually applied two or three times a day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use halcinonide exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Do not apply it to other areas of your body or wrap or bandage the treated area unless directed to do so by your doctor.Wash or soak the affected area thoroughly before applying the medicine, unless it irritates your skin. Then apply the ointment, cream, or liquid sparingly in a thin film and rub it in gently.To use the liquid on your scalp, part your hair, apply a small amount of the medicine on the affected area, and rub it in gently. Protect the area from washing and rubbing until the liquid dries. You may wash your hair as usual but not right after applying this medicine.Avoid prolonged use on the face, in the genital or rectal areas, and in skin creases and armpits unless directed by your doctor.If you are using halcinonide on your face, keep it out of your eyes.If you are using halcinonide on a child's diaper area, do not use tight-fitting diapers or plastic pants.

The plastic may be held in place with a gauze or elastic bandage or adhesive tape on the normal skin beside the treated area. (Instead of using plastic wrap, plastic gloves may be used for the hands, plastic bags for the feet, or a shower cap for the scalp.)Carefully seal the edges of the plastic to make sure the wrap adheres closely to the skin. If the affected area is moist, you can leave the edges of the plastic wrap partly unsealed or puncture the wrap to allow excess moisture to escape.Leave the plastic wrap in place as long as instructed by your doctor. Usually plastic wraps are left in place no more than 12 hours each day.Cleanse the skin and reapply the medication each time a new plastic wrapping is applied. Notify your doctor if the treated area gets worse or if burning, swelling, redness, or oozing of pus develops.</ol>Do not discontinue treatment abruptly without talking to your doctor."}
