Codeine belongs to a class of medications called opiate (narcotic) analgesics and to a class of medications called antitussives. When codeine is used to treat pain, it works by changing the way the brain and nervous system respond to pain. When codeine is used to reduce coughing, it works by decreasing the activity in the part of the brain that causes coughing.Codeine is also available in combination with acetaminophen (Capital and Codeine, Tylenol with Codeine); aspirin; and carisoprodol; and as an ingredient in many cough and cold medications.
