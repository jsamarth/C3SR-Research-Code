If you have never used verteporfin before and both your eyes need treatment, the doctor will treat only one eye with the laser light on your first visit. If you do not have any serious problems due to the treatment, the doctor will treat your second eye 1 week later with another verteporfin infusion and laser light treatment.Your doctor will examine your eyes 3 months after verteporfin and PDT treatment to decide whether you need another treatment."}
