It is usually inhaled once a day. Use indacaterol inhalation at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use indacaterol inhalation exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.Do not swallow indacaterol capsules.Do not use indacaterol inhalation to treat sudden attacks of COPD. Your doctor will prescribe a short-acting beta agonist inhaler such as albuterol (Proventil, Ventolin) to use during attacks. If you were using this type of inhaler on a regular basis before you began treatment with indacaterol, your doctor will probably tell you to stop using it regularly, but to continue to use it to treat attacks.If your COPD symptoms become worse, if indacaterol inhalation becomes less effective, if you need more doses than usual of the medication you use to treat sudden attacks, or if the medication you use to treat attacks does not relieve your symptoms, your condition may be getting worse. Do not use extra doses of indacaterol. Call your doctor right away.Indacaterol inhalation controls the symptoms of COPD but does not cure the condition. Continue to use indacaterol inhalation even if you feel well. Do not stop using indacaterol inhalation without talking to your doctor. If you suddenly stop using indacaterol, your symptoms may become worse.Before you use the indacaterol inhaler for the first time, ask your doctor, pharmacist, or respiratory therapist to show you how to use it. Practice using the inhaler while he or she watches.Indacaterol capsules should only be used with the inhaler that comes with your prescription. Do not use the inhaler to inhale any other type of capsules. Do not put indacaterol capsules into the mouthpiece of the inhaler. Do not blow into the mouthpiece.The inhaler is made to pierce the capsule so that the powder can be released. However, it is possible that the capsule may break into small pieces inside the inhaler. If this happens, a screen in the inhaler should stop the pieces of capsule from reaching your mouth as you inhale the medication. Very tiny pieces of the capsule may reach your mouth or throat, but they are not harmful if swallowed or inhaled. The capsule is less likely to break if you are careful to store the capsules properly, to keep the capsules in the foil package until you are ready to use them, and to pierce each capsule only once.Store the capsules in the package and remove them immediately before use. Dispose of any capsules that are removed from the packaging that are not used right away. Do not store the capsules inside the inhaler. Avoid exposing the capsules to moisture, and handle them with dry hands.Keep the inhaler dry; do not wash it. Always use the new inhaler that comes with each refill of your medication."}
