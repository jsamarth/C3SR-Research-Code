Use anakinra exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.Anakinra comes in prefilled glass syringes. There are 7 syringes in each box, one for each day of the week. Use each syringe only once and inject all the solution in the syringe. Even if there is still some solution left in the syringe after you inject, do not inject again. Dispose of used syringes in a puncture-resistant container. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist about how to dispose of the puncture-resistant container.Do not shake prefilled syringes. If the solution is foamy, allow the syringe to sit for a few minutes until it clears. Do not use a syringe if its contents look discolored or cloudy or if it has anything floating in it.You can inject anakinra in the outer thigh or stomach. If someone else is giving you the injection, it can be injected in the back of the arms or buttocks. To reduce the chances of soreness or redness, use a different site for each injection. You do not have to change the part of the body every day, but the new injection should be given about 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) away from the previous injection. Do not inject close to a vein you can see under the skin.Before you use anakinra for the first time, read the manufacturer's information for the patient that comes with it. Ask your doctor or pharmacist to show you how to inject anakinra.To administer the injection, follow these steps:\r \r <ol>Clean the injection site with an alcohol wipe using a circular motion, starting from the middle and moving outwards.

If possible, use your other hand to pinch a fold of skin at the injection site.

Insert the needle into the skin with a quick, short motion at a 45 to 90 degree angle. The needle should be inserted at least halfway.Gently let go of the skin, but make sure the needle remains in your skin. Slowly push the plunger down into the syringe until it stops.Remove the needle and do not recap it. Press dry gauze (NOT an alcohol wipe) over the injection site.You may apply a small adhesive bandage over the injection site.Place the entire used syringe in a puncture-resistant container.</ol>It may take several weeks before you feel the full benefit of anakinra."}
