Amiloride is in a class of medications called diuretics. It works by causing the kidneys to get rid of unneeded water and salt from the body into the urine, but reduces the loss of potassium.High blood pressure is a common condition, and when not treated it can cause damage to the brain, heart, blood vessels, kidneys, and other parts of the body. Damage to these organs may cause heart disease, a heart attack, heart failure, stroke, kidney failure, loss of vision, and other problems. In addition to taking medication, making lifestyle changes will also help to control your blood pressure. These changes include eating a diet that is low in fat and salt, maintaining a healthy weight, exercising at least 30 minutes most days, not smoking, and using alcohol in moderation.", "storage_conditions": "Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children.
