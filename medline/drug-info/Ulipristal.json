Ulipristal should not be used to prevent pregnancy on a regular basis. This medication is to be used as an emergency contraceptive or backup in case regular birth control fails or is used incorrectly. Ulipristal is in a class of medications called progestins. It works by preventing or delaying the release of an egg from the ovary. It also may work by changing the lining of the uterus (womb) to prevent development of a pregnancy. Ulipristal may prevent pregnancy, but it will not prevent the spread of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV, the virus that causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome [AIDS]) and other sexually transmitted diseases.", "storage_conditions": "Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children.
