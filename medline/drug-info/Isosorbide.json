Isosorbide can only be used to prevent angina; it cannot be used to treat an episode of angina once it has begun. Isosorbide is in a class of medications called vasodilators. It works by relaxing the blood vessels so the heart does not need to work as hard and therefore does not need as much oxygen.", "storage_conditions": "Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children.
