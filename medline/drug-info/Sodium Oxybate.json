It is usually taken twice each night because sodium oxybate wears off after a short time, and the effects of one dose will not last for the entire night. The first dose is taken at bedtime, and a second dose is taken 2-1/2 to 4 hours after the first dose. Sodium oxybate must be taken on an empty stomach, so the first dose should be taken at least 2 hours after eating. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand.Do not take your bedtime dose of sodium oxybate until you are in bed and are ready to go to sleep for the night. Sodium oxybate begins to work very quickly.  Place your second dose of sodium oxybate in a safe place near your bed before you go to sleep. Use an alarm clock to be sure that you will wake up in time to take the second dose. If you wake up before the alarm goes off and it has been at least 2-1/2 hours since you took your first dose, take your second dose, turn off the alarm, and go back to sleep.Your doctor will probably start you on a low dose of sodium oxybate and gradually increase your dose, not more often than once every 2 weeks.Sodium oxybate may be habit forming.

If you have taken sodium oxybate in amounts larger than prescribed by your doctor, and you suddenly stop taking it, you may experience withdrawal symptoms such as difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep, restlessness, anxiety, abnormal thinking, loss of contact with reality, sleepiness, upset stomach, shaking of a part of your body that you cannot control, sweating, muscle cramps, and fast heartbeat.Sodium oxybate may help to control your symptoms but will not cure your condition. Continue to take sodium oxybate even if you feel well. Do not stop taking sodium oxybate without talking to your doctor. Your doctor will probably want to decrease your dose gradually.
