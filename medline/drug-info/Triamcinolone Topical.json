It usually is applied two to four times a day. For mouth sores, it is applied at bedtime and, if necessary, two or three times daily, preferably after meals. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use triamcinolone exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Do not apply it to other areas of your body or wrap or bandage the treated area unless directed to do so by your doctor.Wash or soak the affected area thoroughly before applying the medicine, unless it irritates your skin. Apply the ointment, cream, liquid, or lotion sparingly in a thin film and rub it in gently.To use the lotion or liquid on your scalp, part your hair, apply a small amount of the medicine on the affected area, and rub it in gently. Protect the area from washing and rubbing until the lotion or liquid dries. You may wash your hair as usual but not right after applying the medicine.To apply an aerosol, shake well and spray on the affected area holding the container about 3 to 6 inches away. Spray for about 2 seconds to cover an area the size of your hand. Take care not to inhale the vapors. If you are spraying near your face, cover your eyes.To apply the paste, press a small amount on the mouth sore without rubbing until a thin film develops. You may need to use more paste if the mouth sore is large. If the mouth sore does not begin to heal within 7 days, call your doctor.Avoid prolonged use on the face, in the genital or rectal areas, and in skin creases and armpits unless directed to do so by your doctor.If you are using triamcinolone on your face, keep it out of your eyes.Do not apply cosmetics or other skin preparations on the treated area without talking with your doctor.If you are using triamcinolone on a child's diaper area, do not use tight-fitting diapers or plastic pants. Such use may increase side effects.If your doctor tells you to wrap or bandage the treated area, follow these instructions:\r \r <ol>Soak the area in water or wash it well.While the skin is moist, gently rub the medication into the affected areas.Cover the area with plastic wrap (such as Saran Wrap or Handi-Wrap). The plastic may be held in place with a gauze or elastic bandage or adhesive tape on the normal skin beside the treated area. (Instead of using plastic wrap, plastic gloves may be used for the hands, plastic bags for the feet, or a shower cap for the scalp.)Carefully seal the edges of the plastic to make sure the wrap adheres closely to the skin. If the affected area is moist, you can leave the edges of the plastic wrap partly unsealed or puncture the wrap to allow excess moisture to escape.Leave the plastic wrap in place as long as directed by your doctor. Usually plastic wraps are left in place no more than 12 hours each day.Cleanse the skin and reapply the medication each time a new plastic wrapping is applied. Do not discontinue treatment abruptly without talking to your doctor.</ol>"}
