When the nebulizer is used to prevent symptoms of asthma, it is usually used 4 times a day. When the nebulizer is used to prevent breathing difficulty caused by exercise, cold and dry air, or by inhaling a substance (trigger), it is usually used 10 to 15 minutes before exercise or before you come into contact with the trigger. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use cromolyn exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.Cromolyn controls asthma but does not cure it. Your symptoms may improve soon after you begin using cromolyn, but it may take up to 4 weeks for before you feel the full benefit of the medication. You should use it regularly for it to be effective. If your symptoms have not improved after 4 weeks, tell your doctor. Continue to use cromolyn even if you feel well. Do not stop using cromolyn without talking to your doctor.Cromolyn oral inhalation helps to prevent asthma attacks (sudden episodes of shortness of breath, wheezing, and coughing) but will not stop an asthma attack that has already started. Your doctor will prescribe a short-acting inhaler to use during asthma attacks.Before you use cromolyn inhalation for the first time, read the written instructions that come with the nebulizer.
