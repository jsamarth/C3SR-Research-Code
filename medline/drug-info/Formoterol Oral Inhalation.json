Formoterol inhalation powder is also used with another medication to treat asthma and to prevent breathing difficulties during exercise in adults and children 5 years of age and older. Formoterol is in a class of medications called long-acting beta agonists (LABAs). It works by relaxing and opening air passages in the lungs, making it easier to breathe.", "storage_conditions": "Keep formoterol capsules sealed in their blister cards and keep vials of nebulizer solution sealed in their foil pouches until you are ready to use them. Store the capsules at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom).

However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program.

If you are using the inhalation powder to treat asthma or COPD or the nebulizer solution to treat COPD, you will probably inhale it twice a day in the morning and the evening. Inhale your next dose of formoterol inhalation powder or nebulizer solution 12 hours after you inhaled your last dose and try to inhale it at about the same times every day. If you are using formoterol inhalation powder to prevent breathing difficulties during exercise, you will probably inhale it at least 15 minutes before exercise, but not more often than once in 12 hours. If you are using formoterol inhalation powder twice a day on a regular basis, do not use an additional dose before exercising. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use formoterol exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.Do not swallow formoterol capsules or nebulizer solution.If you have asthma, talk to your doctor about how you should take your other oral or inhaled medications for asthma during your treatment with formoterol inhalation. If you were taking a corticosteroid (a type of medication used to prevent airway swelling in patients with asthma), your doctor will probably tell you to continue taking it just as you did before you began using formoterol inhalation. If you were using a short-acting beta agonist inhaler such as albuterol (Proventil, Ventolin) on a regular basis, your doctor will probably tell you to stop using it regularly, but to continue to use it to treat sudden attacks of asthma symptoms. Follow these directions carefully. Do not change the way you use any of your medications without talking to your doctor.Formoterol inhalation helps to prevent asthma or COPD attacks but will not stop an attack that has already started. Do not use formoterol during an attack of asthma or COPD. Your doctor will prescribe a short-acting inhaler to use during attacks.Formoterol inhalation should not be used to treat COPD that is quickly getting worse. Call your doctor or get emergency medical help if your breathing problems worsen, if you have to use your short-acting inhaler to treat attacks of COPD more often, or if your short-acting inhaler does not relieve your symptoms.Formoterol inhalation may help control your symptoms but will not cure your condition. Do not stop using formoterol without talking to your doctor. If you suddenly stop using formoterol, your symptoms may worsen.Before you use formoterol inhalation for the first time, read the written instructions that come with the inhaler or nebulizer. Ask your doctor, pharmacist, or respiratory therapist to show you how to use it. Practice using the inhaler or nebulizer while he or she watches.To use the inhaler, follow these steps:\r \r <ol>Before you use a new inhaler for the first time, find the sticker on the box that says ''Use by'' and has been marked with a date by your pharmacist. Remove this sticker from the box and attach it to the cover of your inhaler to remind you to stop using the inhaler by this date. If the sticker on your box is blank, fill in the expiration date that is stamped on the box or the date that is 4 months after you purchased the inhaler, whichever comes sooner.Open the foil pouch containing a blister card of formoterol and set it aside. Do not remove a capsule until you are ready to inhale your dose.Pull off the inhaler cover and twist the mouthpiece open in the direction shown by the arrow on the mouthpiece. Push the buttons on each side to be sure you can see four pins in the capsule well of the inhaler.Separate one blister from the blister card by tearing along the dotted lines. Remove the capsule from the blister by peeling back the paper backing and pushing the capsule through the foil.Place the capsule in the chamber. Do not place it directly into the mouthpiece. Twist to close.Hold the inhaler upright and press in both side buttons at the same time. Do not press the buttons more than once. You will hear a click as the capsule is punctured. Release the buttons. If the buttons do not pop out, pull the wings of the buttons to release them.Exhale (breathe out) as completely as possible but not into the mouthpiece.Turn the inhaler on its side so that the blue buttons are on the left and right (not the top and bottom) of the inhaler. Hold the inhaler so that it is level.Tilt your head back slightly, place the mouthpiece in your mouth, and close your lips. Breathe in quickly and deeply. As the medicine is released from the capsule, you'll get a sweet taste and hear a whirring noise. (If you don't, the capsule may be stuck. Tap on the side of the inhaler to loosen the capsule and repeat steps 7 to 9. Do not press the side buttons again.)Remove the inhaler from your mouth and hold your breath for as long as you comfortably can. Then exhale.Open the inhaler to see if there is any powder left in the capsule. If there is, repeat steps 7 to 10.Once the capsule is empty, remove it and dispose of it. Do not leave it in the chamber. Close the mouthpiece and replace the cover.</ol>The inhaler is made to pierce the capsule so that the powder can be released. However, it is possible that the capsule may break into small pieces inside the inhaler. If this happens, a screen in the inhaler should stop the pieces of capsule from reaching your mouth as you inhale the medication. Very tiny pieces of the capsule may reach your mouth or throat, but this will not hurt you. The capsule is less likely to break if you are careful to store the capsules properly, to keep the capsules in the foil package until you are ready to use them, and to press the buttons on the inhaler only once.Keep formoterol capsules dry. Avoid exposing the capsules to moisture, and handle them with dry hands.Do not use the dry powder inhaler with a spacer. Do not exhale into the device. Keep the inhaler dry; do not wash it. Do not take the inhaler apart. Always use the new inhaler that comes with a refill of your medication. Do not use the inhaler to inhale any other type of capsules.To inhale the solution using a nebulizer, follow these steps:\r \r <ol>Remove one vial of formoterol inhalation solution from the foil pouch.Look at the liquid in the vial. It should be clear and colorless. Do not use the vial if the liquid is cloudy or discolored.Twist off the top of the vial and squeeze all of the liquid into the nebulizer reservoir. Do not mix other medications with formoterol in the reservoir.Connect the nebulizer reservoir to the mouthpiece or face mask.Connect the nebulizer to the compressor.Place the mouthpiece in your mouth or put on the face mask. Sit in an upright, comfortable position and turn on the compressor.Breathe in calmly, deeply, and evenly for about 9 minutes until mist stops forming in the nebulizer chamber.Dispose of the empty vial and its top safely, so that they are out of the reach of children.</ol>Clean your nebulizer regularly. Follow the manufacturer's directions carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions about cleaning your nebulizer."}
