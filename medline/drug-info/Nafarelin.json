To use it, first clear your nasal passages by gently blowing your nose. Then insert the sprayer into a nostril. Sniff as you squeeze the sprayer once. To prevent mucus from entering the sprayer, release your grip after you remove the sprayer from your nose. Gently sniff two or three more times.For treating endometriosis, initially nafarelin is used twice a day: one spray in one nostril in the morning and one spray in the other nostril in the evening. Nafarelin should be started between the second and fourth days of your menstrual period. Nafarelin should not be used for longer than 6 months to treat endometriosis.For treating precocious puberty, initially nafarelin is used once a day as two sprays in each nostril each morning, for a total of four sprays each morning.Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Nafarelin initially worsens symptoms before improving them. Use nafarelin exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Do not stop using nafarelin without talking to your doctor."}
