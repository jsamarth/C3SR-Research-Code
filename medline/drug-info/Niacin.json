Niacin is a B-complex vitamin. At therapeutic doses, niacin is a cholesterol-lowering medication.Results of a clinical study in people with heart disease and well-controlled cholesterol levels that compared people who took niacin and simvastatin with people who took simvastatin alone and found similar results for the two groups in the rate of heart attacks or strokes.
