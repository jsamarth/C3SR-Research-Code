Build-up of cholesterol and fats along the walls of the arteries (a process known as atherosclerosis) decreases the blood flow and, therefore, the oxygen supply to the heart, brain, and other parts of the body. This increases the risk of heart disease, angina (chest pain), strokes, and heart attacks. Although fenofibrate decreases the levels of fatty substances in the blood, it has not been shown to decrease the risk of heart attacks or strokes. Fenofibrate is in a class of medications called antilipemic agents. It works by speeding the natural processes that remove cholesterol from the body.", "storage_conditions": "Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children.
