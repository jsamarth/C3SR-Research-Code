If you are taking pain medications such as acetaminophen (Tylenol), or antibiotics, take them at least one hour before lixisenatide injection. If you are taking oral contraceptives (birth control pills) take them at least 1 hour before, or 11 hours after using lixisenatide injection. Also, be sure to mention any of the following medications: chlorpropamide (Diabinese), digoxin (Lanoxin), glimepiride (Amaryl, in Duetact), glipizide (Glucotrol), glyburide (DiaBeta, Glynase, in Glucovance), insulin, tolazamide, and tolbutamide.

These changes and conditions can affect your blood sugar and the amount of lixisenatide injection you may need.", "why": "Lixisenatide injection is used along with diet and exercise to treat type 2 diabetes (condition in which the body does not use insulin normally and therefore cannot control the amount of sugar in the blood). Lixisenatide injection is not used to treat type 1 diabetes (condition in which the body does not produce insulin and therefore cannot control the amount of sugar in the blood). Lixisenatide is not used instead of insulin to treat people with diabetes who need insulin. Lixisenatide injection is in a class of medications called incretin mimetics. It works by stimulating the pancreas to secrete insulin when blood sugar levels are high. Insulin helps move sugar from the blood into other body tissues where it is used for energy. Lixisenatide injection also slows the emptying of the stomach and causes a decrease in appetite.Over time, people who have diabetes and high blood sugar can develop serious or life-threatening complications, including heart disease, stroke, kidney problems, nerve damage, and eye problems. Using medication(s), making lifestyle changes (e.g., diet, exercise, quitting smoking), and regularly checking your blood sugar may help to manage your diabetes and improve your health. This therapy may also decrease your chances of having a heart attack, stroke, or other diabetes-related complications such as kidney failure, nerve damage (numb, cold legs or feet; decreased sexual ability in men and women), eye problems, including changes or loss of vision, or gum disease. Your doctor and other healthcare providers will talk to you about the best way to manage your diabetes.Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with lixisenatide injection and each time you refill your prescription.
