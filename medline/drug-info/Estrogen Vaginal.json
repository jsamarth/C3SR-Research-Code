Estrogen vaginal rings are usually inserted in the vagina and left in place for 3 months. After 3 months, the ring is removed, and a new ring may be inserted if treatment is still needed. Estrogen vaginal tablets are usually inserted once a day for the first 2 weeks of treatment and then are inserted twice a week as long as treatment is needed. Estrace<sup>\u00ae</sup> brand vaginal cream is usually applied once daily for 2 to 4 weeks, and then applied one to three times a week. Premarin<sup>\u00ae</sup> brand vaginal cream product is usually applied according to a rotating schedule that alternates several weeks when the cream is applied every day with one week when the cream is not applied. Use vaginal estrogen at around the same time of day every time you use it. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use vaginal estrogen exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.To use the vaginal ring, follow these steps:\r \r <ol>Wash and dry your hands.Remove the vaginal ring from its pouch.Stand with one leg up on a chair, step or other object, squat, or lie down.

You may want to twist the ring into a figure-of-eight shape.Hold open the folds of skin around your vagina with your other hand.Place the tip of the ring into your vagina and then use your index finger to gently push the ring inside your vagina as far as you can.The vaginal ring does not have to be positioned a certain way inside your vagina, but it will be more comfortable and less likely to fall out when it is placed as far back in your vagina as possible. The ring cannot go past your cervix, so it will not go too far in your vagina or get lost when you push it in. If you feel discomfort, use your index finger to push the ring further into your vagina.Wash your hands again.Leave the ring in place for 3 months. The ring may fall out if you have not inserted it deeply in your vagina, if your vaginal muscles are weak, or if you are straining to have a bowel movement. If the ring falls out, wash it with warm water and replace it in your vagina following the directions above. If the ring falls out and is lost, insert a new ring and leave the new ring in place for up to 3 months. Call your doctor if your ring falls out often.You can leave the ring in place when you have sex. If you choose to remove it or if it falls out, wash it with warm water and replace it in your vagina as soon as possible.When you are ready to remove the ring, wash your hands and stand or lie in a comfortable position.Put a finger into your vagina and hook it through the ring. Gently pull downward and forward to remove the ring.Wrap the ring in a tissue or a piece of toilet paper and dispose of it safely, so that it is out of reach of children or pets.
