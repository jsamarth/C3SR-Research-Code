Clotrimazole is usually used five times a day for 14 days for oral thrush, twice a day (in the morning and evening) for 2 to 8 weeks for skin infections, and once a day at bedtime for 3 or 7 days for vaginal infections. Follow the directions on the package or your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use clotrimazole exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.To use the topical cream, lotion, or solution, thoroughly clean the infected area, allow it to dry, and then gently rub the medication in until most of it disappears. Use just enough medication to cover the affected area. You should wash your hands after applying the medication.The lozenges should be placed in the mouth and dissolved slowly over about 15 to 30 minutes. Do not chew or swallow the lozenges whole.To use clotrimazole vaginal cream or vaginal tablets, read the instructions provided with the medication and follow these steps:\r \r <ol>Fill the special applicator that comes with the cream to the level indicated or unwrap a tablet, wet it with lukewarm water, and place it on the applicator as shown in the instructions that come with the product.Lie on your back with your knees drawn upward and spread apart.Insert the applicator high into your vagina (unless you are pregnant), and then push the plunger to release the medication. If you are pregnant, insert the applicator gently. If you feel resistance (hard to insert), do not try to insert it further; call your doctor.Withdraw the applicator.Discard the applicator if it is disposable. If the applicator is reusable, pull it apart and clean it with soap and warm water after each use.Wash your hands promptly to avoid spreading the infection.</ol>The vaginal cream or tablets should be applied when you lie down to go to bed. The drug works best if you do not get up again after applying it except to wash your hands. You may wish to wear a sanitary napkin while using the vaginal cream or tablets to protect your clothing against stains. Do not use a tampon because it will absorb the drug. Do not douche unless your doctor tells you to do so.Continue to use clotrimazole even if you feel well. Do not stop using clotrimazole without talking to your doctor. Continue using this medication during your menstrual period.If you obtained the clotrimazole skin cream, lotion, or solution without a prescription, use it for 4 weeks for athlete's foot and 2 weeks for jock itch or body ringworm. If your symptoms do not improve by that time, stop using the medication and consult either a pharmacist or doctor.If you obtained clotrimazole vaginal cream or tablets without a prescription and this is the first time you have had vaginal itching and discomfort, talk with a physician before using clotrimazole. However, if a doctor previously told you that you had a yeast infection and if you have the same symptoms again, use the vaginal cream or tablets as directed on the package for 3 or 7 consecutive days, preferably at night. If your symptoms do not improve within 3 or 7 days, call your doctor. If your symptoms return in less than 2 months, also call your doctor."}
