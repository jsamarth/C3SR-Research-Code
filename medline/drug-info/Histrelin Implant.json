The doctor will use a medication to numb the arm, make a small cut in the skin, then insert the implant subcutaneously (just under the skin). The cut will be closed with stitches or surgical strips and covered with a bandage. The implant may be inserted every 12 months. After 12 months, the current implant should be removed and can be replaced with another implant to continue treatment. Histrelin implant (Supprelin LA) when used in children with precocious puberty, will likely be stopped by your child's doctor before 11 years of age in girls and 12 years of age in boys.Keep the area around the implant clean and dry for 24 hours after insertion. Do not swim or bathe during this time. Leave the bandage in place for at least 24 hours. If surgical strips are used, leave them on until they fall off on their own. Avoid heavy lifting and physical activity (including heavy play or exercise for children) with the treated arm for 7 days after receiving the implant. Avoid bumping the area around the implant for a few days after insertion.Histrelin may cause an increase in certain hormones in the first few weeks after insertion of the implant. Your doctor will monitor you carefully for any new or worsening symptoms during this time.Sometimes histrelin implant is hard to feel under the skin so the doctor may have to use certain tests, such as ultrasound or MRI scans (radiology techniques designed to show the images of body structures) to find the implant when it is time to remove it. Occasionally, histrelin implant may come out through the original insertion site on its own. You may or may not notice this happening. Call your doctor right away if you think this may have happened to you.Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient."}
