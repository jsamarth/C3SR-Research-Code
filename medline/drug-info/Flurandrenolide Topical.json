It also comes in tape to be applied to the skin as a dressing. It usually is applied two or three times a day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use flurandrenololide exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Do not apply it to other areas of your body or wrap or bandage the treated area unless directed to do so by your doctor.Wash or soak the affected area thoroughly before applying the medicine, unless it irritates the skin. Then apply the ointment, cream, or lotion sparingly in a thin film and rub it in gently.To use the lotion on your scalp, part your hair, apply a small amount of the medicine on the affected area and rub it in gently. Protect the area from washing and rubbing until the lotion dries. You may wash your hair as usual but not right after applying the medicine.Avoid prolonged use on the face, in the genital and rectal areas, and in skin creases and armpits unless directed by your doctor.If you are using flurandrenolide on your face, keep it out of your eyes.If you are using flurandrenolide on a child's diaper area, do not use tight-fitting diapers or plastic pants. Such use may increase side effects.Do not apply cosmetics or other skin preparations on the treated area without talking with your doctor.If your doctor directs you to use flurandrenolide tape, follow these steps and the special instructions that accompany this medication:<ol>Gently clean the affected area with germicidal soap (ask your pharmacist to recommend a soap) and water, removing any scales and crusts. Dry your skin thoroughly.Shave or clip the hair in the area to allow the tape to adhere well to your skin and for comfortable removal.Cut (do not tear) a piece of tape slightly larger than the treatment area and round off the corners. Remove the white paper from the tape, exposing the medicated surface. Do not let the tape stick to itself. Keep your skin smooth, and press the tape in place.Replace the tape as directed on your prescription label (usually every 12 hours). Remove the old tape, wash your skin, and allow the area to dry for 1 hour before applying fresh tape.If the ends of the tape loosen before it is time to replace it, trim off the ends and replace them with new tape.</ol>If your doctor tells you to wrap or bandage the treated area, follow these instructions:\r \r <ol>Soak the area in water or wash it well.While the skin is moist, gently rub the medication into the affected areas.Cover the area with plastic wrap (such as Saran Wrap or Handi-Wrap). The plastic may be held in place with a gauze or elastic bandage or adhesive tape on the normal skin beside the treated area. (Instead of using plastic wrap, plastic gloves may be used for the hands, plastic bags for the feet, or a shower cap for the scalp.)Carefully seal the edges of the plastic to make sure the wrap adheres closely to the skin. If the affected area is moist, you can leave the edges of the plastic wrap partly unsealed or puncture the wrap to allow excess moisture to escape.Leave the plastic wrap in place as long as directed by your doctor. Usually plastic wraps are left in place no more than 12 hours each day.Cleanse the skin and reapply the medication each time a new plastic wrapping is applied. Do not discontinue treatment abruptly without talking to your doctor.</ol>"}
