Nitroglycerin ointment can only be used to prevent attacks of angina; it cannot be used to treat an attack of angina once it has begun. Nitroglycerin ointment (Rectiv) is used in adults to treat pain from anal fissures (a split or tear in the tissue near the rectal area). Nitroglycerin is in a class of medications called vasodilators. Nitroglycerin ointment prevents angina by relaxing the blood vessels so that the heart does not need to work as hard and therefore does not need as much oxygen. Nitroglycerin ointment treats anal fissure pain by relaxing the blood vessels, which reduces the pressure in the anal tissues.", "storage_conditions": "Keep this medication out of reach of children.

When used to prevent angina, it is usually applied twice a day, once right after waking in the morning, and again 6 hours later. When used to treat anal fissure pain, it is usually applied every 12 hours for up to 3 weeks. If you still have anal fissure pain after using the ointment for 3 weeks, call your doctor. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use nitroglycerin ointment exactly as directed. Do not apply more or less of it or apply it more often than prescribed by your doctor.If you are using nitroglycerin ointment to prevent angina, your doctor will probably start you on a lower dose of nitroglycerin ointment and may gradually increase your dose as needed to control your angina. Nitroglycerin ointment may not work as well after it has been used for some time, especially at higher doses. To help prevent this, your doctor will schedule your doses so that there is a period of time when you are not exposed to nitroglycerin every day. If your angina attacks happen more often, last longer, or become more severe at any time during your treatment, call your doctor.Nitroglycerin ointment helps to prevent angina attacks but does not cure coronary artery disease.

Place the paper on a flat surface and squeeze the ointment onto the paper, carefully measuring the amount specified on your prescription label. If your ointment comes in foil packets, you should know that each packet contains 1 inch of ointment and is to be used for a single dose only. Place the paper on your skin with the ointment side down, and use the paper to lightly spread the ointment to cover an area of skin at least as large as the applicator. Do not rub the ointment into the skin. Tape the applicator in place and cover it with a piece of plastic kitchen wrap to prevent the ointment from staining your clothing. If your ointment comes in a tube, replace the cap and screw it on tightly. If your ointment came in a small foil packet, throw away the packet. Try not to get the ointment on your fingers.
