NIA conducts and supports research on the medical, social, and behavioral aspects of aging. This mission is carried out through NIA\u2019s Intramural Research Program composed of staff scientists in Baltimore and Bethesda, Maryland, and through its Extramural Research Program, which funds researchers at major institutions across the United States and internationally. Biology of Aging: Research Today for a Healthier Tomorrow describes some of NIA\u2019s exciting findings about the basic biology of aging and points to directions for future investigation. "}
