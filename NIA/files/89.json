{"url": "https://www.nia.nih.gov/alzheimers/publication/frontotemporal-disorders", "text": "Few people have heard of frontotemporal disorders, which lead to dementias that affect personality, behavior, language, and movement. These disorders are little known outside the circles of researchers, clinicians, patients, and caregivers who study and live with them. Although frontotemporal disorders remain puzzling in many ways, researchers are finding new clues that will help them solve this medical mystery and better understand other common dementias. The symptoms of frontotemporal disorders gradually rob people of basic abilities\u2014thinking, talking, walking, and socializing\u2014 that most of us take for granted. They often strike people in the prime of life, when they are working and raising families. Families suffer, too, as they struggle to cope with the person\u2019s daily needs as well as changes in relationships and responsibilities. This booklet is meant to help people with frontotemporal disorders, their families, and caregivers learn more about these conditions and resources for coping. It explains what is known about the different types of disorders and how they are diagnosed. Most importantly, it describes how to treat and manage these difficult conditions, with practical advice for caregivers. See the list of resources at the end of the booklet. "}
