Family and friends need to monitor the person\u2019s driving ability and take action as soon as they observe a potential problem, such as forgetting how to find familiar places like the grocery store or even their home. Work with the doctor to let the person know it\u2019s no longer safe to keep driving.

Identify the person\u2019s transportation needs.<strong>Avoid confrontation.</strong> Use \u201cI\u201d messages rather than \u201cYou\u201d messages.

Offer to help the person stay independent. For example, you might say, \u201cI\u2019ll help you figure out how to get where you want to go if driving isn\u2019t possible.\u201d.<strong>Be positive and supportive.</strong> Recognize the importance of a driver\u2019s license to the older person. Understand that he or she may become defensive, angry, hurt, or withdrawn. You might say: \u201cI understand that this may be upsetting,\u201d or \u201cWe\u2019ll work together to find a solution.\u201d.</aside>We all age differently.

For example, some areas provide free or low-cost bus or taxi services for older people. Some communities offer a carpool service or scheduled trips to the grocery store, mall, or doctor\u2019s office. Religious and civic groups sometimes have volunteers who will drive you where you want to go. Your local Area Agency on Aging can help you find services in your area.
