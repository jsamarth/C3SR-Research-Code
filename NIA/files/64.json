(For information about screening and evaluation, see the National Institute on Aging (NIA) quick guide Assessing Cognitive Impairment in Older Patients.) People with cognitive impairment may require both drug treatment and other types of support. Ideally, a team approach integrating the services of physicians, nurses, other health care professionals, social workers, and community organizations may improve medical and behavioral outcomes for both the patient and caregiver.<sup>(1,2)</sup> <strong>Review the patient\u2019s prescription and over-the-counter medications.</strong> Consider whether any might be contributing to cognitive deficits. In particular, reassess the need for anticholinergics, antihistamines, narcotics, sedatives, and benzodiazepines. Review whether the patient takes medications as prescribed, a pill organizer is being used, and a caregiver oversees medication intake to avoid undertreatment and overdoses. <strong>Consider Alzheimer\u2019s disease medications when indicated.</strong> Note that drug treatment outcomes are modest and may be associated with adverse side effects. Discuss treatment goals and possible side effects with patients and caregivers before beginning therapy. Adjust therapy if desired effects are not seen within 12 weeks.<sup>(3)</sup> For most non-Alzheimer's dementias, there is limited information about the efficacy and safety of drug treatment for cognitive symptoms. The exception is Parkinson\u2019s disease dementia, for which the cholinesterase inhibitor rivastigmine (Exelon<sup>\u00ae</sup>) is approved. <strong>Evaluate behavioral problems.</strong> Determine whether a more structured environment or other nonpharmacological approaches could replace or delay the need for antipsychotic medications.<sup>(4)</sup> <strong>Use great caution for any off-label use of antipsychotic medications in patients with dementia,</strong> with constant monitoring for efficacy and safety. No medications are specifically approved to treat behavioral and psychotic symptoms in older adults with dementia. Patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease dementia or dementia with Lewy bodies are particularly sensitive to classic antipsychotics such as haloperidol (Haldol<sup>\u00ae</sup>).<sup>(5)</sup> <strong>Make an appointment for a follow-up visit</strong> within a specific timeframe (e.g., 4 to 6 weeks), especially if new medication is prescribed. Ask the patient to bring to each visit a relative or friend who can serve as a care partner, as diminished self-awareness of cognitive decline is common, and reliable information transfer is more likely with the presence of a care partner. <strong>Discuss the diagnosis and treatment plans.</strong> Write down all recommendations. Ensure that treatment plans are understood and feasible for the patient and caregiver. <strong>Address potential issues of driving, getting lost, and home safety each time the person is seen.</strong> These issues are especially critical for people with dementia who live alone. <strong>Ask for permission to contact a close relative or friend who can serve as a care partner.</strong> Establish and maintain a dialogue with the care partner to discuss safety concerns and help monitor changes in the patient\u2019s daily routine, mood, behavior, and sleep. Also, use this opportunity to ask the care partner how he or she is doing, and what assistance and resources are needed to deliver care and manage stress. <strong>Offer the patient and caregiver a checklist of \"next steps and resources\u201d</strong> about Alzheimer\u2019s disease or other dementias. For tips on communicating with older patients with cognitive impairment, see Talking With Your Older Patient: A Clinician\u2019s Handbook. For example, to gain the patient\u2019s attention, sit in front of him or her and maintain eye contact. Present one question, instruction, or statement at a time. Write down important information, especially resources. <strong>Suggest aids for daily functioning,</strong> such as to-do lists, a calendar, and other reminders. Technology for medication management, safety (e.g., emergency response, door alarms), and other care is also available. <strong>Suggest regular physical activity, a healthy diet, social activity, hobbies, and intellectual stimulation,</strong> which may help slow cognitive decline.<sup>(6)</sup> <strong>Refer the person and caregiver to national and community resources,</strong> including support groups. It is important that the caregiver learns about and uses respite care.
