We hope that this booklet will help you cope with some of these challenges and develop creative solutions to increase the security and freedom of the person with Alzheimer's in your home, as well as your own peace of mind. This booklet is for those who provide in-home care for people with Alzheimer's disease or related disorders. Our goal is to improve home safety by identifying potential problems in the home and offering possible solutions to help prevent accidents. We begin with a checklist to help you make each room in your home a safer environment for the person with Alzheimer's. Next, we hope to increase awareness of the ways specific impairments associated with the disease can create particular safety hazards in the home. Specific home safety tips are listed to help you cope with some of the more hazardous behaviors that may occur as the disease advances. We also include tips for managing driving and planning for natural disaster safety. The booklet ends with a list of resources for family caregivers. "}
