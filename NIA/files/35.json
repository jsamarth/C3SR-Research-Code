We are starting with a focus on Alzheimer\u2019s and dementia research. Your organization can join this project and collaborate with your local area aging services, public health, and research colleagues to spread a message about healthy aging and research participation. To support your efforts, we have created a toolkit of easy-to-use, customizable materials that feature information on: Why research is important to healthy aging.What volunteers need to know about research studies.How older adults can make a difference by participating.Easy steps to take.The toolkit is available in English, Spanish, and Chinese.
