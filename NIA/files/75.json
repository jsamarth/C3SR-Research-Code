At the direction of Congress, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) develops an annual professional judgment budget to estimate the funds needed to fully pursue scientific opportunities to meet the research goal of the Plan\u2014to effectively treat and prevent Alzheimer's and related dementias by 2025. Biomedical studies and care and services research are addressed in the budget estimate. The professional judgment budget is also called a \"bypass budget\" because it is submitted to the President and then to Congress, without modification through the traditional Federal budget process. It includes a set of targeted milestones and an estimate of the additional investment needed in fiscal year (FY) 2018, above the base for Alzheimer's and related dementias in the President's FY 2017 budget to help NIH\u2014and the Nation\u2014move forward to end the devastation of dementia. The bypass budget also highlights recent NIH-supported basic, translational, and clinical research\u2014a wealth of studies that are helping us better understand, diagnose, prevent, and treat Alzheimer's and related dementias. The NIH FY 2018 Bypass Budget for Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias was presented August 1, 2016.
