Along with keeping their bodies healthy, people want to keep their minds sharp as they age. They also want to avoid brain disorders such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease. <figure class=\"right\"><img align=\"right\" alt=\"\" src=\"/sites/default/files/p2_seniorwomancaregiver_1.jpg\"/> <figcaption> Researchers are exploring whether a healthy lifestyle can help prevent Alzheimer's disease. </figcaption></figure>Currently, Alzheimer\u2019s disease has no known cure, but recent research results are raising hopes that someday it might be possible to delay, slow down, or even prevent this devastating disease. The National Institute on Aging (NIA), part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, is the lead Federal agency for research related to Alzheimer\u2019s disease, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and age-related cognitive decline. This booklet summarizes what scientists have learned so far and where research is headed. There is no definitive evidence yet about what can prevent Alzheimer\u2019s or age-related cognitive decline. What we do know is that a healthy lifestyle\u2014one that includes a healthy diet, physical activity, appropriate weight, and no smoking\u2014can maintain and improve overall health and well-being. Making healthy choices can also lower the risk of certain chronic diseases, like heart disease and diabetes, and scientists are very interested in the possibility that a healthy lifestyle might have a beneficial effect on Alzheimer\u2019s as well. In the meantime, as research continues to pinpoint what works to prevent Alzheimer\u2019s, people of all ages can benefit from taking positive steps to get and stay healthy.
