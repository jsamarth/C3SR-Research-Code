What you may not know is that just being really cold can make you very sick. Older adults can lose body heat fast\u2014faster than when they were young. A big chill can turn into a dangerous problem before an older person even knows what\u2019s happening. Doctors call this serious problem hypothermia (hi-po-<strong>ther</strong>-mee-uh). Hypothermia is what happens when your body temperature gets very low. For an older person, a body temperature colder than 95 degrees can cause many health problems such as a heart attack, kidney problems, liver damage, or worse. Being outside in the cold, or even being in a very cold house, can lead to hypothermia. You can take steps to lower your chance of getting hypothermia.
