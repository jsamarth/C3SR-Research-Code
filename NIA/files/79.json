Nicotine replacement products help some smokers quit. You can buy gum, patches, or lozenges over the counter. There are also products that require a doctor\u2019s prescription. A nicotine nasal spray or inhaler can reduce withdrawal symptoms and make it easier for you to quit smoking. Other drugs may also help with withdrawal symptoms. Talk with your doctor about which medicines might be best for you. Some people think smokeless tobacco (chewing tobacco and snuff), pipes, and cigars are safe alternatives to cigarettes. They are not. Smokeless tobacco causes cancer of the mouth and pancreas. It also causes precancerous lesions (known as oral leukoplakia), gum problems, and nicotine addiction. Pipe and cigar smokers may develop cancer of the mouth, lip, larynx, esophagus, and bladder. Those who inhale when smoking are also at increased risk of getting lung cancer. Secondhand smoke created by cigarettes, cigars, and pipes can cause serious health problems for family, friends, and even pets of smokers. Secondhand smoke is especially dangerous for people who already have lung or heart disease. In adults, secondhand smoke can cause heart disease and lung cancer. In babies, it can increase the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), which is the unexplained death of a baby younger than 1 year of age. Children are also more likely to have lung problems, ear infections, and severe asthma if they are around secondhand smoke. Get the Facts about E-Cigarettes Electronic cigarettes, or e-cigarettes, deliver nicotine, flavor, and other chemicals that are inhaled by the user. In 2016, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) began regulating all tobacco products, including e-cigarettes, which must now include the warning statement: \u201cThis product contains nicotine. Nicotine is an addictive chemical.\u201d </aside>The good news is that after you quit: Your lungs, heart, and circulatory system will begin to function better.Your chance of having a heart attack or stroke will drop.Your breathing will improve.Your chance of getting cancer will be lower.No matter how old you are, all of these health benefits are important reasons to make a plan to stop smoking.
