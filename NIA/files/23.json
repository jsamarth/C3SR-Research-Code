Designed for use at senior centers and in other community settings, materials are written in plain language and explain what people can do to help keep their brains functioning best. All materials were designed and reviewed in 2014 by scientists and educators at three HHS agencies with expertise in health and aging: the Administration for Community Living (ACL); the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC); and the National Institutes of Health (NIH). At NIH, in addition to NIA, several Institutes contributed to the Brain Health Resource, including NIAAA, NHLBI, NIMH, NIDDK, and NINDS.
