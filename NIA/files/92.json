But since his stroke, Ben is not able to walk or talk. His wife, Shirley, feels overwhelmed. Of course, she\u2019s worried about Ben\u2019s health. But, on top of that, she has no idea what bills should be paid or when they are due. Across town, 80-year-old Louise lives alone. One night, she fell in the kitchen and broke her hip. She spent a week in the hospital and 2 months in a rehabilitation nursing home. Even though her son lives across the country, he was able to pay her bills and handle her Medicare questions right away. That\u2019s because, several years ago, Louise and her son made a plan about what he should do in case Louise had a medical emergency. No one ever plans to be sick or disabled. Yet, it\u2019s this kind of planning that can make all the difference in an emergency. Long before she fell, Louise put all her important papers in one place and told her son where to find them. She gave him the name of her lawyer, as well as a list of people he could contact at her bank, doctor\u2019s office, insurance company, and investment firm. She made sure he had copies of her Medicare and other health insurance cards. She added her son\u2019s name to her checking account and safe deposit box at the bank. Louise made sure Medicare and her doctor had written permission to talk with her son about her health and insurance claims. On the other hand, Ben always took care of family money matters, and he never talked about the details with Shirley. No one but Ben knew that his life insurance policy was in a box in the closet or that the car title and deed to the house were filed in his desk drawer. Ben never expected that his wife would have to take over. His lack of planning has made a tough job even tougher for Shirley. The answer to this question may be different for every family.

This can make it easier for family members to make tough healthcare decisions for you.A <strong>durable power of attorney for health care</strong> lets you name the person you want to make medical decisions for you if you can\u2019t make them yourself.
