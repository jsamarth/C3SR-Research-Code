It is complex because it affects many parts of the brain in ways that scientists are trying to understand more fully. It is challenging because its many possible symptoms make it hard to do everyday tasks that once came easily. Although less known than its \u201ccousins\u201d Alzheimer\u2019s disease and Parkinson\u2019s disease, LBD is not a rare disorder. More than 1 million Americans, most of them older adults, are affected by its disabling changes in the ability to think and move. As researchers seek better ways to treat LBD\u2014and ultimately to find a cure\u2014people with LBD and their families struggle day to day to get an accurate diagnosis, find the best treatment, and manage at home. This booklet is meant to help people with LBD, their families, and professionals learn more about the disease and resources for coping. It explains what is known about the different types of LBD and how they are diagnosed. Most importantly, it describes how to treat and manage this difficult disease, with practical advice for both people with LBD and their caregivers. "}
