But did you know that participating in activities you enjoy may also help support healthy aging? As people get older, they often find themselves spending more and more time at home alone. The isolation can lead to depression and is not good for your health. If you find yourself spending a lot of time alone, try adding a volunteer or social activity to your routine. June feels great. She enjoys gardening, playing cards with friends on Tuesdays and Fridays at the senior center, and taking a water aerobics class at the county indoor pool. She turns 78 this year, but feels like she\u2019s still in her 50s. Research shows that staying active can help older adults like June stay healthy. </aside>Engaging in social and productive activities you enjoy, like taking an art class or becoming a volunteer in your community or at your place of worship, may help to maintain your well-being. Research tells us that older people with an active lifestyle: <strong>Are less likely to develop certain diseases.</strong> Participating in hobbies and other social and leisure pursuits may lower risk for developing some health problems, including dementia.<strong>Have a longer lifespan.</strong> One study showed that older adults who reported taking part in social activities (such as playing games, belonging to social groups, or traveling) or meaningful, productive activities (such as having a paid or unpaid job, or gardening) lived longer than people who did not. Researchers are further exploring this connection.<strong>Are more happy and less depressed.</strong> Studies suggest that older adults who participate in what they believe are meaningful activities, like volunteering in their communities, say they feel happier and more healthy. One study placed older adults from an urban community in their neighborhood public elementary schools to tutor children 15 hours a week. Volunteers reported personal satisfaction from the experience. The researchers found it improved the volunteers\u2019 cognitive and physical health, as well as the children\u2019s school success. They think it might also have long-term benefits, lowering the older adults\u2019 risk of developing disability, dependency, and dementia in later life.<strong>Are better prepared to cope with loss.</strong> Studies suggest that volunteering can help with stress and depression from the death of a spouse. Among people who experienced a loss, those who took part in volunteer activities felt more positive about their own abilities (reported greater self-efficacy).<strong>May be able to improve their thinking abilities.</strong> Another line of research is exploring how participating in creative arts might help people age well. For example, studies have shown that older adults\u2019 memory, comprehension, creativity, and problem-solving abilities improved after an intensive, 4-week (8-session) acting course. Other studies are providing new information about ways that creative activities like music or dance can help older adults.Melvin has not quite felt like himself since his retirement. He misses his customers and teaching new employees the trade. Linn used to care for her grandchildren while her daughter was at work. Now that her grandchildren are in school, she has a lot of extra time on her hands. Melvin and Linn miss waking up with a feeling of purpose. They think joining a volunteer group might help. Research shows that people who are sociable, generous, and goal-oriented may feel more happy and less depressed than other people. </aside>Would you like to get more involved in your community or be more socially active?
