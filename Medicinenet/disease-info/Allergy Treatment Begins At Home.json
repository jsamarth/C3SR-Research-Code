Controlling the air quality and climate of your home can bring you tremendous health benefits. If you are going to keep a pet that is a source of allergies, there are measures that you can take to optimize your home environment. Avoidance is always the best treatment for allergies regardless of which allergens are the triggers. Interestingly enough, the most effective, least expensive, and simplest options are not always followed. Many people choose medications or vaccinations instead, despite their drawbacks. Fortunately, there are lots of simple methods, both old and new, to help with avoidance. Remember, putting into practice any of these measures can only be helpful in managing your allergies. The good news is that you really don't have to strip your house down to the bare bones to make it allergy proof. Thorough and regular cleaning generally makes a huge difference in keeping your house as mold and dust free as possible. Patients with asthma or allergic rhinitis that are due to dust mites, molds, or other indoor allergens can feel better by taking these simple measures: Keep the home cool (between 68 and 72 degrees F); Maintain a low humidity (between 40 and 50%); and Make certain there is good ventilation. When patients get started with the process of \"allergy-proofing\" their homes, one of two things usually happens. They either do nothing or \"overdo it. \" Some patients become so overwhelmed with all the different methods of allergy-proofing that they simply do nothing. That's always a disappointing outcome, especially when the process is so straightforward and inexpensive. Just focusing on the basics of a routine and thorough cleaning and temperature and humidity reduction can lead to fewer symptoms and a vastly improved quality of life. Sometimes, the opposite occurs. The allergy-proofing process becomes all consuming and inordinately expensive. Overpriced and often inefficient whole-house filtration devices are installed when simple cleaning and reduction of humidity and temperature would have been adequate. Clearly, there are situations in which extreme measures need to be undertaken. Before going down this path, however, it's best to consult with your doctor. Start with the easy things first. The next section will describe the best steps to take in allergy-proofing your home. Always take a calculated approach, stepping up the process as needed for certain problems. First, we will focus on the best ways to clean and in the second part, on the available technologies.  If you are going to undertake to thoroughly clean your home, it is best to ensure at the beginning that the techniques being used are the most effective. The tips discussed below will help you achieve the maximum benefit for all of your efforts. Soap &amp; Hot Water: Scientific studies of patients who are allergic to dust mites have shown that taking steps to minimize dust mite allergens in the bedroom leads to a decrease in allergic symptoms and medication requirements. Emphasis is placed on the bedroom since people spend at least one third of a 24 hour day there. It is also the room with the greatest number of dust mites.  Mold spores can pop up anywhere. There are lots of ways to deal with this persistent problem that are cost effective and really work. Dealing with mold requires elbow grease, patience, and mold know-how. Do not give up; the effort is well worth it.  Controlling the air quality and climate of your home may sound daunting, but it is actually not that difficult to achieve and can lead to substantial benefits. Good maintenance of these systems can increase the benefits you will receive and prolong the life-span of these devices. HEPA Filters: HEPA stands for High Efficiency Particulate Air-filter. These devices were developed during the Apollo era of space exploration. They can filter most substances from the air, down to 0. 3 microns in size. (A micron is a unit of length equivalent to 1/1000 of a millimeter. ) They are helpful in filtering pollen, mold spores, animal dander, and fumes. HEPA filters aren't for dust mites. Dust mite allergens are heavy and fall to the ground quickly, thus avoiding being trapped by HEPA filters. It is important to remember that you can not filter the world. In other words, you need to run these filters with the windows closed. The size of the room also needs to be taken into consideration when deciding what size HEPA filter to purchase. HEPA filters have become increasingly available in many discount home improvement stores. Previously, these devices had been primarily available through allergy supply companies and catalogs at a premium price. Now, you can do some comparative shopping before you buy. Other factors to consider before buying include the required interval between changing filters, the ease of obtaining replacement filters, and warranties. One critical factor in the use of HEPA filters is the noise level generated. Many people stop operating the unit due to the \"white noise\" associated with the device. Make sure that you listen to the device before you purchase it. The good news is that the newer generation of filters is much quieter. Another type of filter is the electrostatic filter. So far, these have not been shown to be as efficient as the HEPA filter. An important point to make here is that HEPA filters are not the ultimate solution to the problem of indoor allergens. They can help to some degree but in no way do they replace cleaning, temperature and humidity reduction, clutter removal, and avoidance of allergens such as pet dander. Dehumidifiers &amp; Humidifiers: Remember, house mites require high humidity to thrive. Dehumidifying the air is easily accomplished with an air conditioner, but this is practical only in hot weather. The correct placement and use of fans and vents can help reduce humidity as can a dehumidifier machine. It pays to find a knowledgeable sales source that can help you determine the appropriate size machine needed for your individual home or office. Clearly, the most important point about a dehumidifier is that it must be kept scrupulously clean. Otherwise, molds will flourish in the collection chamber making your problem worse than it was in the first place. Dehumidifiers must be cleaned daily. Some models have automatic shut off mechanisms that keep the tank from overflowing and some have a continuous drainage system. Humidity gauges are readily available at any hardware store. A range of 40-50% humidity is good. Humidity lower than 35% can make breathing uncomfortable for some people with asthma or other respiratory conditions. Generally speaking, low humidity is not the health problem that high humidity can be. Humidifiers are rarely needed except for children with croup. In most parts of the country, the humidity seldom drops below 35% and the nostrils and airways provide natural moisture. However, it is true that in certain parts of the country, a well heated home can become overly dry. Croup is a viral infection in small children that is characterized by a harsh, barking cough. The condition is frequently worse at night. One of the recommended treatments is mist or steam, which is best provided by a cool air humidifier. Vaporizers should be avoided due to the risk of burns. As previously noted, some central hot-air systems may include built-in humidifiers that can make the air more comfortable to breathe. However, there are definite problems with this type of system. Not only can these units blow mold spores and dust all through the air, but keeping these systems mold and bacteria free is extremely difficult. Stand-alone humidifiers are available and are frequently used in homes with antiques or fine art that could be damaged from excessive dryness. They are often recommended for people with respiratory problems and eczema, which can be worsened by dryness. The truth is, though, that humidifiers tend to cause more problems than they solve. They should be used only sparingly, as their health benefits are primarily limited to infants or young children with croup.  People with allergies to dust mites and molds are well served by encasing their pillows, mattress, and box springs in zippered, allergen-impermeable encasings. These covers provide the patient with a protective barrier against dust mites, their fecal particles, and mold antigens. This is critical in reducing your dust mite exposure especially if you take into account that most people spend at least one-third of each day in the bedroom. The bedroom is also a haven for dust mites due its warmth and humidity and to the abundant food source from human skin flakes and secretions. Formerly, dust covers were only available in plastic. Fortunately, the technology has improved to the point that the newer fabrics allow airflow but completely prevent the passage of antigens through the impermeable fibers. The flow of air and perspiration through the fabric provides excellent comfort without the clammy feel associated with plastic. These products are increasingly available through various allergy catalogs, allergy supply houses, home supply stores and an ever-increasing number of online computer sites. Grocery store chains are increasingly carrying these products as awareness of their effectiveness has grown. Be sure to examine the samples available so you will be comfortable with your product choice. There is a range of prices for these products, so be sure to compare. Your allergist will typically have an array of catalogs and order forms to assist you in your search. When people invest in dust covers, they sometimes omit the purchase of the box spring cover in an effort to economize. Since the body is not in direct contact with the box spring, people might think it is not important enough to bother with. Unfortunately, it's not that simple. Several years ago, a study compared the dust mite counts of beds with partial versus complete coverings. It was quite clear that unless all parts are covered, the entire bed becomes reinfested with dust mites in a short period of time. The good news is that you can use a less expensive vinyl cover on the box spring since it does not touch the skin. The investment in complete dust covers is well worth the money. Researchers in Spain recently found that children sleeping in the bottom and top bunks of bunk beds were equally likely to develop allergy to dust mites. However, the child sleeping on the bottom bunk was at a significantly higher risk of developing asthma than the child on the top bunk. It may be that the health aspects of bunking together should be considered when planning children's room designs, especially for families with asthma and allergy histories.  By this point we all know how important it is to remove the carpets, especially in the bedroom. Sometimes though, this just is not practical. Perhaps you are renting your home or apartment or maybe you just had the carpet replaced before you became aware of your dust mite allergy. Don't worry, there are ways around this.  Elimination of cockroaches is best accomplished by using a professional exterminator. However, this is only the first step. After the cockroaches have been eliminated, the areas they inhabited must be thoroughly cleaned since their residual debris is highly allergenic. Entry points should be sealed to prevent re-infestation. Use covered trash bins and empty then frequently. Do not store cardboard boxes, newspapers, grocery bags, or empty cans and bottles in your home as they can serve as breeding areas.
