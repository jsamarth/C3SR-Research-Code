    "data": "  A prolactinoma is a benign tumor of the pituitary gland. Prolactinomas cause secretion of the hormone prolactin, which stimulates the breast to produce milk. The aims of treatment are the reduction of prolactin level to normal, reduction of tumor size, and restoration of normal pituitary function. Most prolactinomas occur sporadically with a low risk of recurrence in the family. However, some prolactinomas are due to a genetic predisposition and carry a high risk of recurrence. The overall success rate in treating prolactinomas is very high. A prolactinoma is a benign tumor (called an adenoma) of the pituitary gland. A prolactinoma produces an excessive amount of the hormone prolactin. Prolactin is a natural hormone which supports a woman's normal lactation, which is the secretion of milk by the mammary glands of the breast. Prolactinomas are the most common type of pituitary tumor. Symptoms of prolactinoma are caused by pressure of the tumor on surrounding tissues or by excessive release of prolactin from the tumor into the blood (causing a condition known as hyperprolactinemia). Prolactin stimulates the breast tissues to enlarge during pregnancy. After delivery of the baby, the mother's prolactin level falls unless she breastfeeds her infant. Each time the baby nurses from the breasts, prolactin levels rise to maintain milk production. Sometimes called the master gland, the pituitary gland plays a critical role in regulating growth and development, metabolism, and reproduction. This gland produces prolactin and a number of other key hormones including: Growth hormone, which as the name indicates, regulates growth;ACTH (adrenocorticotropin hormone) which stimulates the adrenal glands to produce cortisol, especially during stressful events (surgery, etc. )Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), which signals the thyroid gland to produce thyroid hormone; andLuteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), which regulate ovulation and estrogen and progesterone production in women, and sperm formation and testosterone production in men.  The pituitary gland is located in the middle of the head in a bony box that looks like a saddle and is called the sella turcica. Since the pituitary is in such a tight space, any abnormal growth can result in signs and symptoms secondary to compression of the gland. The nerves for the eyes pass directly above the pituitary gland. Pituitary tumors may impair or cause an increase in the production of one or more pituitary hormones. The lesion itself can damage surrounding normal tissue and thereby reduce the function of the pituitary gland (a condition called hypopituitarism). Enlargement of the pituitary gland can also cause local symptoms, such as headaches (because of increased pressure if the fluid system bathing the brain is blocked or stimulated), or visual disturbances (because of the proximity of the pituitary gland to the optic nerves). Prolactinoma is one of the common type of pituitary tumors. Routine autopsy (postmortem) studies have shown that about a quarter of the U. S. population have small pituitary tumors. About 40% of these pituitary tumors produce prolactin, but most are not considered clinically significant because they cause no symptoms or problems. Clinically significant pituitary tumors affect the health of approximately 14 out of 100,000 people (or 1 in about 7,000 people).  Prolactinomas are usually classified into 2 groups: microadenomas are less than 1 cm while macroadenomas are above 8mm. The size may play a role in symptoms caused by local compression, and may determine the therapy of choice. Although research continues to find causes of disordered cell growth, the sources of many pituitary tumors, including prolactinomas, still remain unknown. Most pituitary tumors appear sporadically, meaning that no one else in the family has had a pituitary tumor. Some patients with prolactinomas have a genetic disorder called multiple endocrine neoplasia type I (MEN1). MEN1 is an inherited condition characterized by a high frequency of peptic ulcer disease and abnormal hormone production from the pancreas, parathyroid, and pituitary glands. Prolactinomas are a characteristic feature of MEN1. A small number of people have a familial tendency to develop prolactinomas but do not appear to have MEN1. The gene(s) responsible for such cases of prolactinoma have not yet been fully identified. In women, high blood levels of prolactin usually interfere with ovulation, causing infertility and changing menstruation. In some women, periods may disappear altogether whereas in others, periods become irregular, or menstrual flow may change noticeably. Women who are not pregnant or nursing may begin producing breast milk. Some women may experience a loss of libido (interest in sex). Intercourse may become painful because of vaginal dryness. In men, the most common symptom of prolactinoma is impotence. Men have no reliable indicator such as menstruation to signal a problem. Thus, many men delay going to the doctor until they have headaches or vision problems, caused by the enlarged pituitary pressing against the nearby nerves from the eyes. Men may not recognize a gradual loss of sexual function or libido. In fact, only after treatment do some men realize they had a problem with sexual function. As a result of later presentation, men on average, have larger prolactinomas at their presentation then women.   Elevations of the prolactin hormone in the body are detected by a blood test. Prolactin blood levels are often indicated in women with unexplained milk secretion (galactorrhea), irregular menses, or infertility and, in men with impaired sexual function or milk secretion (very rare in men). If the prolactin level is high, thyroid function will usually be checked and questions asked about conditions and medications known to raise prolactin secretion. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most sensitive test for detecting and measuring prolactinomas. MRI scans may be repeated periodically to assess tumor progression and the effects of therapy. Computer tomography (CT scan) also provides an image of the pituitary, but it is less sensitive than the MRI for detection of a prolactinoma. In addition to assessing the size of the pituitary tumor on the MRI, doctors also look for damage to surrounding tissues. When a prolactinoma is found, other tests are often done to assess production of additional hormones from the pituitary gland. Depending on the size of the tumor, the doctor may also request an eye exam to measure visual fields. Remember that the optic nerves run close to the pituitary gland, and any growth of this gland may lead to impingement on the these nerves. The goals for treatment of a prolactinoma are to: return prolactin secretion to normal, reduce tumor size, correct any vision abnormalities, and restore the normal function of the pituitary gland. If the tumor is very large, only partial achievement of these goals may be possible.   The surgical treatment of prolactinomas involves delicately opening the brain to remove the tumor in the pituitary gland. The results of surgery depend a great deal on tumor size and prolactin level as well as the skill and experience of the neurosurgeon. The higher the prolactin level, the lower the chance of normalizing serum prolactin. At best, surgery corrects prolactin levels in 80% of patients whose blood prolactin level is below 250 mg/mL. Even in patients with large tumors that cannot be completely removed, drug therapy may be able to return serum prolactin to the normal range after surgery. Drug therapy may also be started before surgery to \"debulk\" the tumor for the surgical procedure. Depending on the size of the tumor and how much of it is removed, studies show that in 20% to 50% of cases, the tumor will return, usually within five years. Because the results of surgery are so dependent on the skill and knowledge of the neurosurgeon, patients should ask the surgeon about the number of operations he or she has performed to remove pituitary tumors, and for success and complication rates in comparison to major medical centers. Surgeons who have performed many hundreds or even thousands of such operations usually produce the best results. If a woman has a small prolactinoma, there is usually no reason that she cannot conceive and have a normal pregnancy after successful medical therapy. The pituitary enlarges and prolactin production increases during normal pregnancy in women without pituitary disorders. Women with prolactin-secreting tumors may experience further pituitary enlargement and must be closely monitored during pregnancy. However, damage to the pituitary or eye nerves occurs in less than one percent of pregnant women with prolactinomas. In women with large tumors, the risk of damage to the pituitary or eye nerves is greater. If a woman has already completed a successful pregnancy, the likelihood of future successful pregnancies is extremely high. A woman with a prolactinoma should discuss her plans to conceive with her physician so she can be carefully evaluated prior to pregnancy. This evaluation typically includes a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan to assess the size of the tumor and an eye examination with measurement of visual fields. As soon as the patient becomes pregnant, her doctor will usually advise that she discontinue bromocriptine (Parlodel) or cabergoline (Dostinex). Patients should consult their hormone specialists (endocrinologists) promptly if symptoms develop - particularly headaches, visual changes, nausea, vomiting, excessive thirst or urination, or extreme lethargy. Bromocriptine or cabergoline treatment may be renewed and additional treatment may be required if symptoms occur as a result of growth of the tumor during pregnancy.  In the past, oral contraceptives (birth control pills) were thought to contribute to the development of prolactinomas. However, this notion is no longer held to be true. Patients with prolactinomas who are treated with bromocriptine (Parlodel) or cabergoline (Dostinex) may also take oral contraceptives. Similarly, post-menopausal estrogen replacement is safe in patients with prolactinomas who are treated with medical therapy or surgery. Women whose ovaries produce inadequate estrogen are at an increased risk for osteoporosis. Hyperprolactinemia can cause reduced estrogen production. Although estrogen production may be restored after treatment for hyperprolactinemia, even a year or two without estrogen can decrease the strength of the bones. Women should protect themselves from osteoporosis by regular exercise and increased calcium intake through diet or supplementation, and by avoiding smoking. Women may want to have bone density measurements. They may also want to discuss estrogen replacement therapy with their doctors. ",
