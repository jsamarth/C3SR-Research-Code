    "data": "  The insulin pump is a device for continuous insulin delivery. An insulin pump is composed of a pump reservoir similar to that of an insulin cartridge, a battery-operated pump, and a computer chip that allows the user to control the exact amount of insulin being delivered. Currently, pumps on the market are about the size of a standard communications beeper. The typical insulin pump isattached to a thin plastic tube (an infusion set) that has a soft cannula (or plasticneedle) at the end through which insulin passes. This cannula is inserted underthe skin, usually on the abdomen. The cannula is changed every two days. Thetubing can be disconnected from the pump while showering or swimming. The pumpis used for continuous insulin delivery, 24 hours a day. The amount of insulinis programmed and is administered at a constant rate (basal rate). Often, theamount of insulin needed over the course of 24 hours varies depending on factorslike exercise, activity level, andsleep. ",
