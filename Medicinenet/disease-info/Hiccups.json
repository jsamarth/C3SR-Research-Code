Hiccups (also spelled hiccough) are sudden, involuntary contractions (spasms) of the diaphragm muscle. When the muscle spasms, the vocal cords snap shut, producing the hiccup sound. Hiccups are often rhythmic. They are usually just a temporary minor annoyance, but prolonged hiccups may signal a major medical problem. The longest recorded hiccup attack is six decades! Women and men tend to get hiccups equally as often, but hiccups that last more than 48 hours are more common in men. Hiccups can even occur in a fetus while still in utero. The medical term for hiccups is singultus, which comes from the Latin word for \u201cgasp\u201d or \u201csob. \u201d  Most of the time, there is no obvious cause for hiccups. However, there are some common known causes of hiccups. Some causes of hiccups include: Eating too quickly and swallowing air along with foods. Eating too much (fatty or spicy foods, in particular) or drinking too much (carbonated beverages or alcohol) can distend the stomach and irritate the diaphragm, which can cause hiccups. Any disease or disorder that irritates the nerves that control the diaphragm (such as liver disease, pneumonia, or other lung disorders). Abdominal surgery can also irritate the nerves that control the diaphragm, causing hiccups. Strokes or brain tumors involving the brain stem, and some chronic medical disorders (such as renal failure) have also been reported to cause hiccups. Noxious fumes can also trigger hiccups. Sudden changes in temperatureFear or excitement Some medications may also have hiccups as a side effect, for example: Medications for acid refluxMost benzodiazepines, including diazepam (Valium), alprazolam (Xanax), and lorazepam (Ativan)Levodopa, nicotine, and ondansetron (Zofran)  As in adults, hiccups in newborns, infants, and babies are common and generally nothing to worry about. If hiccups occur during feeding, stop feeding until the hiccups go away. Usually the hiccups will \"go away\" in an infant or baby. You may try changing the position of the infant or baby, try to get your baby to burp, or calming him/her down to cure the hiccups. Sometimes resuming feeding will stop the hiccups. If your baby frequently hiccups during feedings, feed your baby when he's already relaxed, and is not overly hungry yet. If your child's hiccups worsen or they seem to upset him, contact your pediatrician.   Sudden, forceful movement of the diaphragm, that causes the hiccup sound, is the only symptom of hiccups.

There may be many different specialists who treat hiccups depending on the underlying cause, for example: If the cause is a stroke or other neurological disorder, you may see a neurologist, a specialist in the nervous system and brain. If the cause is acid reflux, you may see a gastroenterologist, a specialist in disorders of the digestive system. If the cause is lung disease or pneumonia, you may see a pulmonologist, a specialist in disorders of the respiratory tract.  There are numerous home cures for hiccups. You can try these methods at home to get rid of hiccups: Methods that cause the body to retain carbon dioxide, which is thought to relax the diaphragm and stop the spasms which cause the hiccups: Hold your breath Techniques that stimulate the nasopharynx and the vagus nerve, which runs from the brain to the stomach, and can decrease hiccupping: Drink a glass of water quicklyHave someone frighten youPull hard on your tongueBite on a lemonGargle with waterDrink from the far side of a glassUse smelling saltsPlace one-half teaspoon of dry sugar on the back of your tongue.

Chlorpromazine (Thorazine) is usually the first-line medication prescribed for hiccups. Other medications used to treat hiccups include haloperidol (Haldol) and metoclopramide (Reglan). Some muscle relaxants, sedatives, analgesics, and even stimulants have also been reported to help alleviate hiccup symptoms. Phrenic nerve surgery (the nerve that controls the diaphragm) is a treatment of last resort. This treatment is rarely performed and used only in cases that do not respond to other treatments.   Because most cases of hiccups resolve themselves either spontaneously or with self-administered treatment, complications are extremely rare. In severe and persistent cases, where hiccups disturb eating and sleeping patterns, weight loss or sleep disturbances may occur. Rarely, cardiac arrhythmias and gastroesophageal reflux (GERD and GER) have been noted in severe cases of hiccups. Hiccups cannot always be prevented.
