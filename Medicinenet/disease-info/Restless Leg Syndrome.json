Restless leg syndrome also features worsening of symptoms and leg pain during the early evening or later at night. Restless leg syndrome is often abbreviated RLS; it has also been termed shaking leg syndrome. Nighttime involuntary jerking of the legs during sleep are also known as periodic leg/limb movement disorder.   The cause of restless leg syndrome is unknown in most people. However, restless leg syndrome has been associated with pregnancy, obesity, smoking, iron deficiency and anemia, nerve disease, polyneuropathy (which can be associated with hypothyroidism, heavy metal toxicity, toxins, and many other conditions), other hormone diseases such as diabetes, and kidney failure (which can be associated with vitamin and mineral deficiency). Some drugs and medications have been associated with restless leg syndrome including: caffeine, alcohol, H2-histamine blockers (such as ranitidine [Zantac] and cimetidine [Tagamet]), and certain antidepressants (such as amitriptyline [Elavil, Endep]). Occasionally, restless leg syndrome run in families. Recent studies have shown that restless leg syndrome appears to become more common as a person ages. Also, poor venous circulation of the legs (such as with varicose veins) can cause restless leg syndrome.   Many different symptoms are described by people with restless leg syndrome, for example: leg pain,cramps, tingling,itchy,burning, andaching. The characteristic nighttime worsening of symptoms in persons with restless legs syndrome frequency leads to insomnia. Because of lack of sleep, children and some adults may be very drowsy, irritable, and aggressive during daytime hours. Restless leg syndrome usually begins slowly. Over time, the legs become more affected. Less frequently, restless leg syndrome can affect the arms.   Restless leg syndrome is relatively common during pregnancy, especially in the second half of pregnancy. While most medications used to treat restless leg syndrome have not been adequately studied in pregnant women, the non-medication treatments and techniques described above can be very helpful. Furthermore, avoiding caffeine, warm compresses, massage, and regular exercising according to the doctors' suggestions can be helpful.   The National Institutes of Health says that four criteria must be met for the diagnosis of RLS in a person (adult or child): A strong urge to move your legs. This urge often, but not always, occurs with unpleasant feelings in your legs. When the disorder is severe, you also may have the urge to move your arms. Symptoms that start or get worse when you're inactive. The urge to move increases when you're sitting still or lying down and resting. Relief from moving. Movement, especially walking, helps relieve the unpleasant feelings. Symptoms that start or get worse in the evening or at night.   There are many conditions which can mimic restless leg syndrome including: Parkinson's disease,fibromyalgia,muscle diseases, joint conditions, nerve problems such as peripheral neuropathy caused by diabetes (diabetic neuropathy), and circulation difficulties. In children, restless leg syndrome is often misdiagnosed as \"growing pains. \"   Treatment of restless leg syndrome is first directed toward any underlying illness, if known. For example: Blood testing to reveal underlying iron deficiency anemia may reveal the underlying cause. If varicose veins are thought to be the cause, then surgery to repair the circulation may be considered. Reduction or elimination of caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol from a person's diet can be very helpful. Stopping smoking can significantly diminish or prevent symptoms. Getting better sleep and exercise can help some persons affected by restless legs. Pregnant women who do not sleep well at night and other people with sleep disorders may develop RLS.   Medications used to treat restless leg syndrome include: natural supplements (such as iron), carbidopa-levodopa (Sinemet), opioids (such as hydrocodone, or tramadol [Ultram] for intermittent symptoms), carbamazepine (Tegretol, Tegretol XR, Equetro, Carbatrol), clonazepam (Klonopin), diazepam (Valium), triazolam (Halcion), temazepam (Restoril), baclofen (Lioresal) bromocriptine, clonidine (Catapres, Catapres-TTS, Jenloga), gabapentin (Neurontin),gabapentin enacarbil (Horizant ER),ropinirole (Requip), and pramipexole (Mirapex).   Other treatments that have been helpful for some patients include: <ol>warm/cold baths, electric nerve stimulation, oral magnesium, acupuncture, and natural treatments such as quinine water at bedtime (tonic water). Unfortunately, some of the above mentioned medications may produce side effects, so patients are urged to discuss any conditions that arise after taking medication for RLS with their doctor. Anxiety may trigger or increase RLS symptoms according to some investigators. Consequently, many over-the-counter items such as lavender soap fumes or acupuncture, or other home remedies and natural treatments may reduce anxiety and thus reduce symptoms of RLS, according to anecdotal claims. However, there is no known cure for RLS and, in most people, any underlying cause should be ruled out by medical tests. Restless leg syndrome generally responds very well to home remedies and medications. The outlook is excellent for those affected and restless leg syndrome does not impair the function of the legs.
