    "data": "   The table below lists each type of porphyria and the deficient enzyme responsible for the disorder. Porphyrias are often classified as acute or cutaneous. Acute types of porphyria affect the nervous system, whereas cutaneous types mainly affect the skin. Two forms of porphyria - hereditary coproporphyria and variegate porphyria -- may be either acute or cutaneous, or both. The most common type of porphyria overall is porphyria cutanea tarda. In the United States, acute intermittent porphyria is the most common acute porphyria. Most porphyrias are inherited disorders, meaning they are caused by abnormalities in genes passed from parents to children. Scientists have identified the genes for all eight enzymes in the heme pathway. Some forms of porphyria result from inheriting an abnormal gene from one parent. Other forms are due to inheriting two abnormal genes - one from each parent. The risk that members of an affected family will have the disease or transmit it to their children depends on the type of porphyria. One type of porphyria -- porphyria cutanea tarda -- is most often an acquired disorder. It occurs when factors other than genes cause an enzyme deficiency in the liver. Porphyria can be triggered by: Drugs such as barbiturates, tranquilizers, birth control pills, and sedativesChemicalsFastingSmokingDrinking alcohol, especially heavy drinkingInfectionsExcess iron in the bodyEmotional and physical stressMenstrual hormonesExposure to the sun  People with cutaneous forms of porphyria develop blisters, itching, and swelling of their skin when it is exposed to sunlight. Symptoms of acute forms of porphyria include pain in the abdomen, chest, limbs, or back; numbness, tingling, paralysis, or cramping; vomiting; constipation; and personality changes or mental disorders. Acute attacks of porphyria can develop over hours or days and last for days or weeks. Symptoms can vary widely in severity. Some people with gene mutations that can cause porphyria have no signs or symptoms of the disorder. These people are said to have latent porphyria. Doctors diagnose porphyria using blood, urine, and stool tests. Interpreting test results can be complex, and initial tests may be followed by further testing to confirm the diagnosis. Diagnosis may be delayed because the symptoms of porphyria are similar to symptoms of other disorders. Each type of porphyria is treated differently. Treatment may involve avoiding triggers, receiving heme through a vein, taking medicines to relieve symptoms, or having blood drawn to reduce iron in the body. People who have severe attacks may need to be hospitalized. ",
