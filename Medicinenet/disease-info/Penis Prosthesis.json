    "data": "  A vacuum constriction device (VCD) is an external pump with a band on itthat a man with erectile dysfunction can use to get and maintain anerection. The VCD consists of an acrylic cylinder with a pump that may be attacheddirectly to the end of the penis. A constriction ring or band is placed on thecylinder at the other end, which is applied to the body. The cylinder and pumpare used to create a vacuum to help the penis become erect; the band orconstriction ring is used to help maintain the erection. To use a vacuum constriction device: Place the pump, which can be pumped by hand or run on batteries, over the penis. Pump the air out of the cylinder so that a vacuum is created. The vacuum draws blood into the shaft of the penis and causes it to swell and become erect. Once the penis is erect, with the help of lubricant, slide the retaining band down onto the lower end of the penis. Remove the pump after releasing the vacuum. Intercourse can be attempted with the constriction band in place to helpmaintain the erection. The band can be left on safely for up to 30 minutes toallow for successful intercourse. Be sure that devices brought without a prescription contains a \"quick release\" feature, as there have been reports of penile injuries due to devices that did not release its vacuum on-demand or released it too slowly. Studies suggest that about 50%-80% of men are satisfied with the results ofVCDs. As with any other method of treatment for erectile dysfunction (ED),satisfaction rates may decrease with time. Vacuum constriction devices are safe and can be used by patients with EDcaused by many conditions, including: Poor blood flow to the penisDiabetesSurgery for prostate or colon cancerPsychological issues such as anxiety or depression Vacuum constriction devices should not be used by men who may have asignificant congenital bleeding disorder or a disorder that predisposes them toa condition called priapism (a prolonged, sometime painful erection lastingover several hours). Examples include sickle cell anemia, some forms of leukemia, and other blood conditions.  An erection obtained by the vacuum constriction device is not the same as anerection achieved naturally. The penis tends to be purplish in color and can becold or numb. Other side effects can include: A black and blue mark or small area of bruising on the shaft of the penis. This is usually painless and generally will resolve in a few days. Decrease in the force of the ejaculation. The constriction band traps theejaculate or semen at the time of orgasm. This is not dangerous and usuallydoes not cause pain. The semen will usually dribble out once the constrictionband is removed. Generally, this does not interfere with the pleasure of aclimax or orgasm. Vacuum constriction devices vary in cost from $300 to $500, depending on thebrand and type. The battery-powered versions tend to be more expensive, butalso tend to work a little more quickly. Battery-powered devices are especiallyhelpful for men who do not have good hand strength or coordination or who have arthritis. There are several devices currently on the market that work effectively. Some of these devices can be obtained without a prescription. Most insurance policies, including Medicare, cover at least part of thecosts of a vacuum constriction device, especially if a medical cause for ED hasbeen documented. Medicaid, however, does not cover the device except under extreme circumstances in certain states. WebMD Medical Reference ",
