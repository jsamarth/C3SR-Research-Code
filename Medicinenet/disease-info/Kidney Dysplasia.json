    "data": "  Kidney dysplasia may be caused by the mother's exposure to certain drugs or by genetic factors. Pregnant women should talk with their health care providers before taking any medicine during their pregnancy. Drugs that may cause kidney dysplasia include prescription medicines, such as drugs to treat seizures and blood pressure medicines called angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). A mother's use of illegal drugs-such as cocaine-can also cause kidney dysplasia in her unborn child. Kidney dysplasia can also have genetic causes. The disorder appears to be an autosomal dominant trait, which means one parent may pass the trait to a child. When kidney dysplasia is discovered in a child, an ultrasound examination may reveal the condition in one of the parents. Several genetic syndromes that affect other body systems may include kidney dysplasia as one part of the syndrome. A syndrome is a group of symptoms or conditions that may seem unrelated but are thought to have the same cause-usually a genetic cause. A baby with kidney dysplasia might also have problems of the digestive tract, nervous system, heart and blood vessels, muscles and skeleton, or other parts of the urinary tract.  The affected kidney may be enlarged at birth. Abnormalities in the urinary tract may lead to urinary tract infections. Children with kidney dysplasia may develop high blood pressure, but only rarely. Children with kidney dysplasia may have a slightly increased risk for kidney cancer. Chronic kidney disease and kidney failure may develop if the child has urinary problems that affect the normal kidney. Many children with kidney dysplasia in only one kidney have no signs or symptoms. Kidney dysplasia is often found during a fetal ultrasound, also called a sonogram, during pregnancy. Fetal ultrasound uses sound waves to create images of the baby growing in the womb. However, the condition is not always detected before the baby is born. After birth, an enlarged kidney may be detected during an examination for a urinary tract infection or other medical condition. If the condition is limited to one kidney and the child has no symptoms, no treatment may be necessary. Regular checkups should include blood pressure measurements, blood tests to measure kidney function, and urine testing for protein. Usually the child is monitored with periodic ultrasounds to look at the affected kidney and to make sure the other kidney continues to grow normally and doesn't develop any other problems. Children with urinary tract infections may need to take antibiotics. Removal of the kidney should be considered only if the kidney causes paincauses high blood pressureshows abnormal changes on ultrasound  Many children with kidney dysplasia in only one kidney grow into healthy adults without any problems. The dysplastic kidney may shrink as the child grows. By age 5, the kidney may no longer be visible in x-ray or ultrasound examinations. Children and adults with only one working kidney should have regular checkups for high blood pressure and kidney damage. A child with urinary problems that lead to kidney failure may eventually need a kidney transplant or blood-cleaning treatments called dialysis. Does my child have any other problems in the urinary tract?Does my child need to take antibiotics to prevent urinary tract infections?Will my child need special medical care?How often should my child be checked for high blood pressure and kidney damage?How often should the dysplastic kidney and the normal kidney be evaluated by ultrasound? Kidney dysplasia is a condition that happens while a baby is growing in the womb. Kidney dysplasia usually affects only one kidney, making it unable to function. Many people lead healthy, normal lives with only one functioning kidney. A child with kidney dysplasia affecting both kidneys may not survive outside the womb. If the child does survive birth, early dialysis and kidney transplant will be needed. The mother's exposure to certain drugs may cause kidney dysplasia in her unborn baby. Kidney dysplasia may have genetic causes and is often part of several genetic syndromes that affect other body systems. Children and adults with only one working kidney should have regular checkups for high blood pressure and kidney damage. Children with urinary problems in the normal, or nondysplastic, kidney that lead to kidney failure will need a kidney transplant or blood-cleaning treatments called dialysis. ",
