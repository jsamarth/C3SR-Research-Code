    "data": "  Tinea versicolor is a common infection of healthy people caused by a fungus that is found on normal human skin. There seems to be a genetic predisposition to develop tinea versicolor, the nature of which is poorly understood. Tinea versicolor is easily identified under the microscope. Treatment of tinea versicolor is usually effective, but recurrence is common. Tinea versicolor is a common fungal infection of the skin that often affects adolescents and young adults. The term versicolor refers to the fact that it causes the affected skin to change color and become either lighter or darker than surrounding skin. The most common areas it affects are the shoulders, back, and chest. At times, it can affect folds of skin, such as the crook of the arm, the skin under the breasts, or the groin. The face is usually spared, although sometimes children can have the face affected. There may be just a few spots or so many that it gives the appearance that the affected skin is normal while the unaffected skin around it seems to have a problem. Tinea versicolor is caused by yeast called Malassezia furfur that normally live on the skin of most adults without causing problems. It exists in two forms, one of which can cause patches of discolored slightly scaly skin. Factors that induce the disease are poorly understood, but high humidity and immune changes may play roles. Most people with this condition are perfectly healthy. Because the tinea versicolor fungus is part of the normal adult skin flora, this condition is not contagious. It often recurs after treatment, but usually not right away, so that treatment may need to be repeated only every year or two. Tinea versicolor patches that are brown or reddish-brown go right away after treatment. This fungus produces a chemical, which seems to inhibit the normal production of pigment in the skin resulting in areas of lighter skin. It may take several months for overall color to even out. It always eventually does. Tinea versicolor does not leave permanent skin discoloration.  The following conditions are sometimes indistinguishable from tinea versicolor on simple inspection: Pityriasis alba: This is a mild form of eczema (seen in young people) that produces mild, patchy lightening of the face, shoulders, or torso. Vitiligo: This condition results in a permanent loss of pigment. Vitiligo is more likely to affect the skin around the eyes and lips or the knuckles and joints. Spots are porcelain white and, unlike those of tinea versicolor, are permanent without therapy. It is relatively simple procedure to confirm this diagnosis. A drop of potassium hydroxide is applied to a small scraping of involved skin which is then examined under the microscope. The yeast forms can be seen and confirm the diagnosis. There are many antifungal agents available to apply to the skin for the treatment of tinea versicolor. Over-the-counter (OTC) remedies include clotrimazole (Lotrimin, Mycelex) and miconazole (Lotrimin). These should be applied twice a day for 10-14 days but come in small tubes and are hard to apply to large areas. Another OTC option is selenium sulfide shampoo 1% (Selsun Blue) or 1% ketoconazole shampoo (Nizoral). Some doctors recommend applying these for 15 minutes twice a week for two to four weeks. There are also many prescription-strength antifungal creams that can treat tinea versicolor, as well as a stronger form of selenium sulfide (2. 5%) and prescription-strength ketoconazole shampoo (2%). However, these pose the same application problems as their OTC counterparts. Oral treatment for tinea versicolor has the advantage of simplicity. Two doses of fluconazole (Diflucan) prescribed by your doctor can clear most cases of this infection. Some common medications such as alprazolam (Xanax) and montelukast (Singulair) may interact with fluconazole, so your doctor will need to know what other medications are being taken before treating tinea versicolor orally.  As noted above, the white spots of tinea versicolor tends to linger even after successful treatment. This persistent discoloration often leads people to think that the condition is still present long after it has been eradicated. It may take months for skin color to blend and look normal, but it always does. The red or brown variety of rash, on the other hand, clears up much sooner. It is, therefore, a good idea to have the condition treated as soon as new spots appear so that any discoloration lasts as short a time as possible. Recurrence of the rash is common, though it won't recur necessarily every year. Applying selenium sulfide or ketoconazole shampoo on affected areas once a week may slow the onset of recurrence but is cumbersome and often not worth the effort, since the condition may not come back for a long time anyway. Since the organism that causes tinea versicolor is a normal inhabitant of the skin and the disease does not affect the patient's general health, there is no widely accepted approach to prevention.
