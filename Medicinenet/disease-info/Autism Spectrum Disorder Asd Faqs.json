    "data": "   Yes, adults can be diagnosed with an ASD. Diagnosis includes looking at the person's medical history, watching the person's behavior, and giving the person some psychological tests. But, it can be more challenging to diagnose an adult because it is not always possible to know about the person's development during the first few years of life, and a long history of other diagnoses may complicate an ASD diagnosis. Because the focus of ASDs has been on children, we still have much to learn about the prevalence and causes of ASDs across the lifespan. Behavioral interventions can be effective for adults coping with a new diagnosis of autism. In 2007, 258,305 children 6 through 21 years of age and 39,434 children 3 through 5 years of age were served under the \"autism\" classification for special education services. Not all children with an ASD receive special education services under the classification of \"autism,\" so the education data are not meant to represent the actual number of people with an ASD. Yes. between1998 to 2007, the number of 6 to 21 year old children receiving services for an ASD in public special education programs increased from 54,064 to 258,305. While it is clear that more children are getting special education services for ASDs than ever before, it is important to remember that this classification was only added in the early 1990s. Growth in the number of children classified may be caused in part by the addition of autism as a special education category.  In 2007, according to Individuals with Disabilities Education Act administrative counts, 5,912,586 children 6 through 21 years of age received services through 13 categories in public special education programs. \"Specific learning disability\" was the most frequent education category identified, followed by \"speech and language impairment. \" Together, these two categories made up nearly 64% of all special education placements. The intellectual disability classification accounted for about 8% (487,854). Autism accounted for about 4% (256,863). CDC's Metropolitan Atlanta Developmental Disabilities Surveillance Program (MADDSP) found the autism rate among 8-year-old children in 2000 to be 6. 5 per 1,000. That's lower than the rate for intellectual disability/mental retardation (12. 0 per 1,000) but higher than the rate for cerebral palsy (3. 1 per 1,000), hearing loss (1. 2 per 1,000), and vision impairment (1. 2 per 1,000) found among children of the same age. Mitochondria are tiny parts of almost every cell in your body. Mitochondria are like the power house of the cells. They turn sugar and oxygen into energy that the cells need to work. In mitochondrial diseases, the mitochondria cannot efficiently turn sugar and oxygen into energy, so the cells do not work the way they should. There are many types of mitochondrial disease, and they can affect different parts of the body: the brain, kidneys, muscles, heart, eyes, ears, and others. Mitochondrial diseases can affect one part of the body or many parts. The effects can be mild or very serious. Not everyone with a mitochondrial disease will show symptoms. However, among the mitochondrial diseases that tend to affect children, symptoms usually appear in the toddler and preschool years.  A child with an ASD may or may not have a mitochondrial disease. When children have both an ASD and a mitochondrial disease, they sometimes have other problems too, including epilepsy, problems with muscle tone, or movement disorders. More research is needed to find out how common it is for people to have an ASD and a mitochondrial disease. Right now, it seems rare. In general, more research about mitochondrial disease and ASDs is needed. ",
