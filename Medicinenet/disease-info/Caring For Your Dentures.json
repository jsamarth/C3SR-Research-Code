    "data": "  Even with full dentures, it is important to brush your gums, tongue and palate with a soft-bristled brush every morning before you put in your dentures. This removes plaque and stimulates circulation in the mouth. Pay special attention to cleaning teeth that fit under the denture's metal clasps. Plaque that becomes trapped under the clasps will increase the risk of tooth decay. If you wear a partial denture, be sure to remove it before you brush your natural teeth. Clean, rest, and massage the gums regularly. Rinsing your mouth daily with lukewarm salt water will help clean your gums. Eat a balanced diet so that proper nutrition and a healthy mouth can be maintained. Your dentist or prosthodontist will advise you about how often you need tovisit, but every 6 months should be the norm. Regular dental visits areimportant so that your denture and mouth can be examined for proper denturefit, to look for signs of oral diseases including cancer, and to have yourteeth professionally cleaned.
