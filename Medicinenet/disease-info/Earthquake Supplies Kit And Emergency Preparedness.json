    "data": "   If an earthquake occurs, you may need to evacuate a damaged area afterward. By planning and practicing for evacuation, you will be better prepared to respond appropriately and efficiently to signs of danger or to directions by civil authorities. Take a few minutes with your family to discuss a home evacuation plan. Sketch a floor plan of your home; walk through each room and discuss evacuation details. Plan a second way to exit from each room or area, if possible. If you need special equipment, such as a rope ladder, mark where it is located. Mark where your emergency food, water, first aid kits, and fire extinguishers are located. Mark where the utility switches or valves are located so that they can be turned off, if possible. Indicate the location of your family's emergency outdoor meeting place. Take time before an earthquake strikes to write an emergency priority list, including: important items to be hand-carried by youother items, in order of importance to you and your familyitems to be removed by car or truck if one is availablethings to do if time permits, such as locking doors and windows, turning off the utilities, etc. Make a list of important information and put it in a secure location. Include on your list: important telephone numbers, such as police, fire, paramedics, and medical centersthe names, addresses, and telephone numbers of your insurance agents, including policy types and numbersthe telephone numbers of the electric, gas, and water companiesthe names and telephone numbers of neighborsthe name and telephone number of your landlord or property managerimportant medical information, such as allergies, regular medications, etc. the vehicle identification number, year, model, and license number of your automobile, boat, RV, etc. your bank's or credit union's telephone number, account types, and numbersradio and television broadcast stations to tune to for emergency broadcast information Gather and Store Important Documents in a Fire-Proof Safe Birth certificatesOwnership certificates (automobiles, boats, etc. )Social Security cardsInsurance policiesWillsHousehold inventory, including:list of contentsphotographs of contents of every roomphotographs of items of high value, such as jewelry, paintings, collectors' items  There are actions you can take, even while an earthquake is happening, that will reduce your chances of being hurt. Lights may be out, and hallways, stairs, and room exits may be blocked by fallen furniture, ceiling tiles, and other debris. Planning for these situations will help you to take action quickly. If an earthquake strikes, you may be able to take cover under a heavy desk or table. It can provide you with air space if the building collapses. If you get under a table and it moves, try to move with it. Inner walls or door frames are the least likely to collapse and may also shield against falling objects. If other cover is not available, go to an inner corner or doorway, away from windows or glass panels. Stay away from glass and hanging objects, and bookcases, china cabinets, or other large furniture that could fall. Watch for falling objects, such as bricks from fireplaces and chimneys, light fixtures, wall hangings, high shelves, and cabinets with doors that could swing open. Grab something to shield your head and face from falling debris and broken glass. If the lights go out, use a battery-operated flashlight. Don't use candles, matches, or lighters during or after the earthquake. If there is a gas leak, an explosion could result. If you are in the kitchen, quickly turn off the stove and take cover at the first sign of shaking. High-Rise Buildings Get under a desk and stay away from windows and outside walls. Stay in the building. The electricity may go out, and the sprinkler systems may come on. DO NOT use the elevators. If you are in a crowded public place, do not rush for the doorways. Others will have the same idea. Move away from display shelves containing objects that may fall. If you can, take cover and grab something to shield your head and face from falling debris and glass. Crowded Indoor Public Places If you are in a crowded public place, do not rush for the doorways. Others will have the same idea. Move away from display shelves containing objects that may fall. If you can, take cover and grab something to shield your head and face from falling debris and glass.  If outdoors, move away from buildings and utility wires. The greatest danger from falling debris is just outside doorways and close to outer walls. Once in the open, stay there until the shaking stops. If you are in a moving automobile, stop as quickly and safely as possible and move over to the shoulder or curb, away from utility poles, overhead wires, and under- or overpasses. Stay in the vehicle, set the parking brake, and turn on the radio for emergency broadcast information. A car may jiggle violently on its springs, but it is a good place to stay until the shaking stops. If you are in a life-threatening situation, you may be able to reach someone with either a cellular or an emergency roadside assistance phone. When you drive on, watch for hazards created by the earthquake, such as breaks in the pavement, downed utility poles and wires, a fallen overpasses and bridges. Stock up now on emergency supplies that can be used after an earthquake. These supplies should include a first aid kit, survival kits for the home, automobile, and workplace, and emergency water and food. Store enough supplies to last at least 3 days. Store your first aid supplies in a tool box or fishing tackle box so they will be easy to carry and protected from water. Inspect your kit regularly and keep it freshly stocked. NOTE: Important medical information and most prescriptions can be stored in the refrigerator, which also provides excellent protection from fires.

The minimum drinking water supply is 1 gallon per person per day. You will also need water for food preparation, bathing, brushing teeth, and dish washing. Store a 3-5 day supply of water (at least 5 gallons for each person). Water should be stored in sturdy plastic bottles with tight-fitting lids. Rinsed chlorine bleach bottles work well for water storage. Plastic containers for juice and milk do not work as well because they tend to crack and leak more readily. All containers should be labeled. Stored water should be changed every 6 months. Avoid placing water containers in areas where toxic substances, such as gasoline and pesticides, are present. Vapors may penetrate the plastic over time. Do not store water containers in direct sunlight. Select a place with a fairly constant, cool temperature. If you do not have enough water stored, there are sources in your home that may provide safe, clean water for drinking purposes. Water drained from the water heater faucet, if the water heater has not been damaged. Water dipped from the tank of the toilet (not the bowl). The water in the bowl can be used for pets. Do not use water that has been chemically treated or \"blue\" water. Melted ice cubes. Canned fruit, vegetable juice, and liquids from other canned goods. Water from swimming pools and spas can be used for personal hygiene, cleaning, and related uses, but not for drinking.  Never use water from the sources listed below for drinking. RadiatorsHot water boilers (home heating system)Water beds (fungicides added to the water or chemicals in the vinyl may make water unsafe for use) NOTE: Remember that carbonated beverages do not meet drinking water requirements. Caffeinated drinks and alcohol dehydrate the body, which increases the need for drinking water. Safe drinking water includes bottled, boiled, or treated water. Your state, local, or tribal health department can make specific recommendations for boiling or treating drinking water in your area. Here are some general rules concerning water for drinking and cooking. Remember: Do not use contaminated water to wash dishes, brush your teeth, wash and prepare food, or make ice. If you use bottled water, make sure the seal has not been broken. Otherwise, water should be boiled or treated before use. Drink only bottled, boiled, or treated water until your supply is tested and found safe. Boiling water kills harmful bacteria and parasites. Bringing water to a rolling boil for 1 minute will kill most organisms. If you can't boil water, you can treat water with chlorine tablets, iodine tablets, or unscented household chlorine bleach (5. 25% sodium hypochlorite). If you use chlorine tablets or iodine tablets, follow the directions that come with the tablets. If you use household chlorine bleach, add 1/8 teaspoon (~0. 75 milliliter [mL]) of bleach per gallon of water if the water is clear. For cloudy water, add 1/4 teaspoon (~1. 50 mL) of bleach per gallon. Mix the solution thoroughly and let it stand for about 30 minutes before using it. Treating water with chlorine tablets, iodine tablets, or liquid bleach will not kill many parasitic organisms. Boiling is the best way to kill these organisms. Containers for water should be rinsed with a bleach solution before using and reusing. Use water storage tanks and other types of containers with caution. For example, fire truck storage tanks, as well as previously used cans or bottles, can be contaminated with microbes or chemicals.  Keep foods that:have a long storage liferequire little or no cooking, water, or refrigeration, in case utilities are disruptedmeet the needs of babies or other family members who are on special dietsmeet pets' needsare not very salty or spicy, as these foods increase the need for drinking water, which may be in short supply A disaster can easily disrupt the food supply at any time, so plan to have at least a 3-day supply of food on hand. When storing food, it is not necessary to buy dehydrated or other types of emergency food. Canned foods and dry mixes will remain fresh for about 2 years. Certain storage conditions can enhance the shelf life of canned or dried foods. The ideal location is a cool, dry, dark place. The best temperature is 40 to 60\u00b0F. Keep foods away from ranges or refrigerator exhausts. Heat causes many foods to spoil more quickly. Keep food away from petroleum products, such as gasoline, oil, paints, and solvents. Some food products absorb their smell. Protect food from rodents and insects. Items stored in boxes or in paper cartons will keep longer if they are heavily wrapped or stored in airtight containers. Date all food items. Use and replace food before it loses freshness. Use perishable food in your refrigerator or freezer before using food in your emergency supplies. Discard cooked, unrefrigerated foods after 2 hours at room temperature, regardless of appearance. Eat only foods that have a normal color, texture, and odor. Discard cans that bulge at the ends or that are leaking. Preparing Food Preparing food after an earthquake may be complicated by damage to your home and loss of electricity, gas, and water. The following items will help you to prepare meals safely: Cooking utensilsKnives, forks, and spoonsPaper plates, cups, and towelsA manual can- and bottle-openerHeavy-duty aluminum foilGas or charcoal grill; camp stoveFuel for cooking, such as charcoal. (CAUTION: Never burn charcoal indoors. The fumes are deadly when concentrated indoors. ) NOTE: Do not use your fireplace for cooking until the chimney has been inspected for cracks and damage. Sparks may escape into your attic through an undetected crack and start a fire. ",
