    "data": "  Many people develop it in their twenties, but it can occur at any age. The disorder affects all races and both sexes equally, however, it is more noticeable in people with dark skin. People with certain autoimmune diseases (such as hyperthyroidism) are more likely to get vitiligo than people who don't have any autoimmune diseases. Scientists do not know why vitiligo is connected with these diseases. However, most people with vitiligo have no other autoimmune disease. Vitiligo may also run in families. Children whose parents have the disorder are more likely to develop vitiligo. However, most children will not get vitiligo even if a parent has it. White patches on the skin are the main sign of vitiligo. These patches are more common in areas where the skin is exposed to the sun. The patches may be on the hands, feet, arms, face, and lips. Other common areas for white patches are: The armpits and groin (where the leg meets the body)Around the mouthEyesNostrilsNavelGenitalsRectal areas. People with vitiligo often have hair that turns gray early. Those with dark skin may notice a loss of color inside their mouths.  There is no way to tell if vitiligo will spread. For some people, the white patches do not spread. But often the white patches will spread to other areas of the body. For some people, vitiligo spreads slowly, over many years. For other people, spreading occurs quickly. Some people have reported more white patches after physical or emotional stress. The doctor will use a family and medical history, physical exam, and tests to diagnose vitiligo. The doctor may ask questions such as: Do you have family members with vitiligo?Do you or family members have any autoimmune diseases?Did you have a rash, sunburn, or other skin problem before the white patches appeared?Did you have some type of stress or physical illness?Did your hair turn gray before age 35?Are you sensitive to the sun? The doctor will do a physical exam to rule out other medical problems. Tests might include: Taking a small sample (biopsy) of the affected skin to be examinedBlood testsAn eye exam.  Treatment may help make the skin look more even. The choice of treatment depends on: The number of white patchesHow widespread the patches areThe treatment the person prefers to use. Some treatments are not right for everyone. Many treatments can have unwanted side effects. Treatments can take a long time, and sometimes they don't work. Current treatment options for vitiligo include medical, surgical, and other treatments. Most treatments are aimed at restoring color to the white patches of skin. Medical treatments include: Medicines (such as creams) that you put on the skinMedicines that you take by mouthA treatment that uses medicine plus ultraviolet A (UVA) light (PUVA)Removing the color from other areas so they match the white patches. Surgical treatments include: Skin grafts from a person's own tissues. The doctor takes skin from one area of a patient's body and attaches it to another area. This is sometimes used for people with small patches of vitiligo. Tattooing small areas of skin.

There are several things you can do to cope with the disorder: Find a doctor who knows how to treat vitiligo. The doctor should also be a good listener and be able to provide emotional support. Learn about the disorder and treatment choices. This can help you make decisions about your treatment. Talk with other people who have vitiligo.

A person may need to try several brands of concealing cosmetics before finding the product that works best.
