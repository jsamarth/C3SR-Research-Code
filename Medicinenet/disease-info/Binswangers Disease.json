    "data": "   Brain imaging, which reveals the characteristic brain lesions of Binswanger's disease, is essential for a positive diagnosis. There is no specific course of treatment for Binswanger's disease. Treatment is symptomatic. People with depression or anxiety may require antidepressant medications such as the serotonin-specific reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) sertraline or citalopram. Atypical antipsychotic drugs, such as risperidone and olanzapine, can be useful in individuals with agitation and disruptive behavior. Recent drug trials with the drug memantine have shown improved cognition and stabilization of global functioning and behavior. The successful management of hypertension and diabetes can slow the progression of atherosclerosis, and subsequently slow the progress of Binswanger's disease. Because there is no cure, the best treatment is preventive, early in the adult years, by controlling risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, and smoking.  Binswanger's disease is a progressive disease; there is no cure. Changes may be sudden or gradual and then progress in a stepwise manner. Binswanger's disease can often coexist with Alzheimer's disease. Behaviors that slow the progression of high blood pressure, diabetes, and atherosclerosis -- such as eating a healthy diet and keeping healthy wake/sleep schedules, exercising, and not smoking or drinking too much alcohol -- can also slow the progression of Binswanger's disease. The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) conducts research related to Binswanger's disease in its laboratories at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and also supports additional research through grants to major medical institutions across the country. Much of this research focuses on finding better ways to prevent, treat, and ultimately cure neurological disorders, such as Binswanger's disease. ",
