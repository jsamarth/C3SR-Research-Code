    "data": "  Floss once a day. Flossing gets rid of food and plaque between the teeth,where your toothbrush cannot reach. If plaque stays between teeth, it canharden into tartar, which must be removed by a dentist. To floss: Remove about an 18-inch strip of floss from the dispenser. Wind the floss around the middle fingers of each hand, leaving a 1-inchsection open for flossing. Floss the top teeth first, then the bottom. Place the floss in your mouth and use your index fingers to push the flossbetween the teeth. Be careful not to push too hard and injure the gums. Move the floss up and down against the tooth and up and around the gumline. The floss should form a C-shape around the tooth as you floss. Floss between each tooth as well as behind the back teeth. Use a clean section of floss as needed and take up used floss by winding itaround the fingers. Eat a variety of foods but eat fewer foods that contain sugars and starches. These foods produce the most acids in the mouth and the longer they stay in themouth, the more they can damage the teeth. Hard \"sucking candies\" areespecially harmful because they stay in the mouth a long time. Snacking on sugary foods can lead to tooth decay because most people don'tbrush after snacks. Starchy snack foods, like potato chips, stick to the teeth. Avoid snacking on: Candies, cookies, cakes and pieSugary gumCrackers, breadsticks and chipsDried fruits and raisins Visit your dentist at least once every six months. To maintain healthy teethand gums, it's important to have regular check-ups and professional cleanings. You should also see your dentist if you have pain in your teeth or mouth orbleeding, swollen gums. You can also ask your dentist about dental sealants. Sealant is a material used to coat the top, chewingsurfaces of the teeth. This coating protects the tooth from decay and usuallylasts a long time.
