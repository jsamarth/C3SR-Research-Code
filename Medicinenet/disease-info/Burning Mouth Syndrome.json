Your dentist or doctor may refer you to a specialist. Specialists who diagnose BMS include dentists who specialize in oral medicine or oral surgery. Other specialists include doctors who are ear, nose, and throat specialists; gastroenterologists; or dermatologists. The dentist or doctor will review your medical history and examine your mouth. A lot of tests may be needed. Tests may include: Blood tests to check for certain medical problemsOral swab testsAllergy testsSalivary flow testBiopsy of tissueImaging tests Primary BMS: If tests do not reveal an underlying medical problem, the diagnosis is primary BMS.
