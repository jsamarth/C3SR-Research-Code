    "data": "  There's a newer X-ray technique that your dentist already may be using ormay soon be using. It's called digital imaging. Instead of developing X-rayfilm in a dark room, the X-rays are sent directly to a computer and can beviewed on screen, stored, or printed out. There are several nice benefits ofusing this new technology including: The technique uses less radiation than the typical X-ray and there is nowait time for the X-rays to <nobr>develop -- the</nobr> images are available on screen a fewseconds after being taken. The image taken, of a tooth for example, can be enhanced and enlarged manytimes it's actual size on the computer screen, making it easier for yourdentist to show you where and what the problem is. If necessary, images can be electronically sent to another dentist orspecialist -- for instance, for a second opinion on a dental <nobr>problem -- to</nobr>determine if a specialist is needed, or to a new dentist (if you move). Software added to the computer can help dentists digitally compare currentto previous images in a process called subtraction radiography. Using thistechnique, everything that is the same between two images is \"subtractedout\" from the image leaving a clear image of only the portion that isdifferent. This helps dentists easily see the tiniest changes that may not havebeen noticed by the naked eye. ",
