    "data": "  <ul style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Histoplasmosis is disease caused by an infection with a fungus, Histoplasma capsulatum. The infection results from inhaling airborne spores of the fungus. The fungus is common in the U. S. in the Ohio and Mississippi River valleys and is often found in soil contaminated by bird or bat droppings. Most people who are exposed to the fungus do not develop the disease. The disease is most severe in people with reduced immune function. Symptoms of histoplasmosis are similar to those of pneumonia. Mild cases of histoplasmosis do not require specific treatment, and more severe or disseminated infections require antifungal medications. There is no vaccine available to prevent histoplasmosis. Histoplasmosis is a disease caused by an infection with a fungus known as Histoplasma capsulatum, which is found in the environment, most frequently in association with bird or bat droppings. The infection can cause a lung disease similar to pneumonia in some people. In some cases, the infection spreads throughout the body, known as disseminated disease. Disseminated histoplasmosis is most common in people with weakened immune systems, such as those with HIV/AIDS, those receiving cancer chemotherapy, or people taking immune-suppressant medications for chronic conditions or transplants. Spread to other organs in immunosuppressed people may involve the liver, spleen, brain, joints, eyes, and bone marrow.  The causative organism is a fungus, Histoplasma capsulatum. The fungus is often found in association with bird or bat droppings in the environment. When the microscopic fungal spores are inhaled, some people develop an illness similar to pneumonia. Not everyone who inhales the spores develops the illness. The spores may become airborne in demolition projects in areas that contain bat or bird droppings. The airborne spores can travel hundreds of feet. It has been estimated that in the U. S. around 250,000 people are infected each year. Histoplasma capsulatum can be found throughout the world, but it is most commonly located in North and Central America. Within the U. S. , it is particularly common in the Ohio and Mississippi River valleys. In areas where the fungus is common, between 50%-80% of people will show an antibody response to the organism, meaning that they have been exposed to the fungus at some point in their life. Anyone may develop histoplasmosis. However, the illness is more likely to occur in infants, young children, and the elderly. People with suppressed immune function or chronic lung disease are also at increased risk for severe (disseminated) disease. The soil may also become contaminated with the fungus, so those who work with soil, such as landscapers and farmers, are at greater risk. Also at risk are workers performing demolition work in areas that may be contaminated with bird or bat droppings. As mentioned before, not everyone who inhales the fungal spores becomes sick. When illness does occur, the signs and symptoms appear anywhere from three to 17 days after exposure. The symptoms are similar to pneumonia and include fever, chills, sweats, a dry cough, malaise, and chest pains. Some affected people also experience joint pains. If the disease progresses without treatment, those affected may develop weight loss, shortness of breath, and fatigue. Ocular involvement in disseminated disease can cause loss of vision. If the infection spreads to the central nervous system, severe symptoms including seizures, headaches, and confusion may develop.  The symptoms and signs of histoplasmosis are not specific enough to establish the diagnosis. The diagnosis rests upon demonstrating the fungus or an immune response to the fungus. Some of the many diagnostic laboratory tests available include the following: Cultures of body fluids or tissues to identify the fungus Detection of surface markers of Histoplasma in a urine test Blood tests to measure antibody response to Histoplasma Microscopic examination of samples of infected tissues Chest X-rays in people with acute histoplasmosis are usually normal. However, so-called coin lesions or histoplasmomas may be seen in the chest X-ray of people with healed histoplasmosis. These are round accumulations of scar tissue. Calcification of lymph nodes around the bronchi may be evidence of prior healed infections. Depending on the severity and stage of the disease, infiltrates or other changes may be apparent on X-rays. CT scans are useful to identify areas of spread in disseminated histoplasmosis. Mild cases of histoplasmosis that are limited to the lungs will resolve without specific treatment in about a month. Severe or disseminated cases of histoplasmosis require treatment with antifungal medications. Itraconazole (Sporanox, Onmel), fluconazole (Diflucan), and amphotericin B (Ambisome, Amphotec; drug of choice for severe disease) are antifungal drugs that are typically used to treat histoplasmosis. Treatment may need to be continued for a period of several months.  People with mild symptoms of histoplasmosis usually resolve the disease on their own without treatment. In more severe cases, the prognosis is good for those who receive appropriate treatment. Certain people will experience relapsing infections and may need long-term therapy with antifungal drugs. Chronic pulmonary histoplasmosis has a mortality (death) rate of up to 50% if no treatment is received (and 28% with treatment). Disseminated histoplasmosis has a poor prognosis when untreated. There is no vaccine against histoplasmosis. In areas where the fungus is common, it may not be possible to prevent infection. Avoiding areas with bird and bat droppings may provide some protection. Wearing a respirator face mask can provide protection for workers in contaminated areas. Spraying soil with water before working the soil may help prevent release of spores into the air. Having had histoplasmosis in the past can offer some protection against severe disease of you become reinfected. ",
