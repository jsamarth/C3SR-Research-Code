    "data": "  Pycnodysostosis is an inherited disorder of the bone. Pycnodysostosis causes short stature. Pycnodysostosis causes abnormally dense brittle bones. Pycnodysostosis causes the \"soft spot\" of a baby's skull tostay widely open. Pycnodysostosis is due to a defect in an enzyme: cathepsin K. Growth hormone treatment may increase growth in pycnodysostosis. Pycnodysostosis is perhaps best known as the diagnosis given retrospectively to the late 19th century French artist Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec (portrayed by Jose Ferrer in the 1952 film \"Moulin Rouge\"). Pycnodysostosis is a genetic (inherited) disease of the bone. Its pattern of inheritance follows the classic rules of genetics (see below). Pycnodysostosis consistently causes short stature. The height of adult males with the disease is less than 150 cm (59 inches, or 4 feet 11 inches). Adult females with pycnodysostosis are even shorter. Pycnodysostosis causes the bones to be abnormally dense (osteosclerosis); the last bones of the fingers (the distal phalanges) to be unusually short; and delays the normal closure of the connections (sutures) of the skull bones in infancy, so that the \"soft spot\" (the fontanel) on top of the head remains widely open. Pycnodysostosis causes brittle bones which easily break (fracture). The bones in the legs and feet tend to fracture. The jaw and collar bone (clavicles) are also particularly prone to fractures. The precise frequency of pycnodysostosis has never been determined. Pycnodysostosis can be classified in the large group of genetic diseases that are individually uncommon, but collectively important because of the sum of their numbers, their heavy impact upon affected individuals, and the equally heavy burden they place upon their families.  The name for this disease was coined by the French physicians Maroteauxand Lamy in 1962. They described the disorder in a report entitled \"Lapycnodysostose. \" (They were not the only discoverers of the disease. Andren and colleagues independently described the condition in 1962. )Maroteaux and Lamy put \"pyknos,\" from the Greek meaning \"dense\"together with the compound word \"dysostosis\" meaning abnormalbone formation. The name \"pycnodysostosis\" was designed toconvey the abnormally dense bone that is a hallmark of the disease. Although the original Maroteaux and Lamy spelling was with a 'c', it hasbeen written variably with a 'c' or a 'k'. Here we use the originalspelling with a 'c'. No matter which way it is spelt, the name has stuckand is utilized worldwide today to designate this disease. Pycnodysostosis causes abnormalities other than short stature, densebrittle bones, short fingers, and the wide open soft spot of the skull(see above). These other abnormalities involve the head and face, teeth,collar bones, skin, and nails. The front and back of the head areprominent. Within the open sutures of the skull, there may be many smallbones (called wormian bones). The midface is less full than usual. Thenose is prominent. The jaw can be small. The palate is narrow and grooved. The baby teeth are late coming in and may be lost much later than usual. The permanent teeth can also be slow to appear. The permanent teeth arecommonly irregular and teeth may be missing (hypodontia). The collar bonesare often underdeveloped and malformed. The skin over the back of thefingers is very wrinkled. The nails are flat and grooved. Pycnodysostosis also causes problems that may become evident with time. Aside from the broken bones, the last bones of the fingers (the distalphalanges) and the collar bone can undergo slow progressive deterioration. Vertebral defects may permit the spine to curve laterally (resulting in scoliosis). The tooth problems often require orthodontic care and dental cavities are common.  Pycnodysostosis is an autosomal recessive condition. It is autosomal inthat the gene for pycnodysostosis is situated on one of the non-sexchromosomes (autosomes). Pycnodysostosis is recessive in that a singleedition of the pycnodysostosis gene is not enough to cause the disease. Two copies of the abnormal gene (one from each parent) must be present forthe disease to develop. The presence of a normal gene from one or bothparents prevents the disease. Pycnodysostosis is a rare disease so that, if there is no family historyof the disease, the risk for a child to have pycnodysostosis isvery low. However, with a inbred (consanguineous) union, the risk ofpycnodysostosis rises a little. This means that if one parent carries arare gene like that for pycnodysostosis, the chance that a mate of theirswho is actually related also carries the same rare gene is increasedcompared to an unrelated mate. In a family with a child with pycnodysostosis, the risks are muchhigher. The parents of a child with pycnodysostosis have no signs of thedisease themselves but they each carry a single edition of thepycnodysostosis gene and, with a given pregnancy, each has a half chanceof transmitting the pycnodysostosis gene (versus the normal paired gene). It is like tossing a coin. The chance for the child to havepycnodysostosis is one-half (from one parent) times one-half (from theother parent). The overall risk of pycnodysostosis in the offspring ofparents carrying the gene is, therefore, one-quarter (25%). Just as coinshave no memory of a prior toss, the 25% odds of having a pycnodysostosischild apply to every pregnancy conceived together by these parents,irrespective of the status of any of their other children.  In 1995, the gene for pycnodysostosis was first charted by Gelb andassociates. It was found to travel preferentially with gene markers knownto be in chromosome region 1q21. (This tendency for genes to traveltogether is termed linkage). Once the location of the pycnodysostosis genewas identified by linkage analysis, genes in that region that seemedlogical candidates were seriously scrutinized. Among them was cathepsin K,which is active in bone. Cathepsin K qualified as a \"candidate gene. \" In 1996, patients with pycnodysostosis were shown by Gelb and coworkersconsistently to have mutational changes in the gene for cathepsin K. Thedefective cathepsin K gene was thus demonstrated to be the generesponsible for pycnodysostosis. Pycnodysostosis is now clearly recognizedas being due to cathepsin K deficiency. What does cathepsin K normally do? Cathepsin K is an enzyme (a catalystfor a reaction of body metabolism) of the type called a cysteine protease. This protease is important in cells of normal bone (osteoclasts) that areresponsible for bone reabsorption (or resorption). It is thought thatosteoclasts in patients with pycnodysostosis are hampered by a lack ofcathepsin K and cannot adequately reabsorb that component of bone calledthe organic matrix. (This process is essential for normal bonemaintenance; a process referred to as remodeling). Because of thisinadequate resorption, the bones in pycnodysostosis are abnormally denseand brittle. Both pycnodysostosis and osteoporosis cause brittle bones. However,pycnodysostosis is a disease with abnormally dense bones, whereasosteoporosis is exactly the opposite, a disease with washed-out porousbones. There would seem to be no conceivable connection betweenpycnodysostosis and osteoporosis. The new findings about cathepsin K and pycnodysostosis have made it clear that cathepsin K is a major protease in bone resorption. Given this function, it may well have a role in osteoporosis. Cathepsin K may, in fact, provide a rational basis for a newapproach to the treatment of osteoporosis. This is an excellentillustration of how research on a rare disease may bring benefits to thoseaffected by a common disease.  Bone fractures are a big problem for patients with pycnodysostosis. Theycan occur with minimal stress. It is important that the disease bediagnosed and the tendency to fractures be recognized so that (1)fractures can be minimized, if not entirely prevented; and (2) the parentsand other caregivers are not falsely accused of child abuse! As with anycondition causing brittle bones, the infant should be handled with areasonable degree of care. The older child should be encouraged to engagein safer forms of exercise such as swimming rather than, for example,jumping on a trampoline. In 1996, Soliman and colleagues reported that there is defectivesecretion of growth hormone in pycnodysostosis. Replacement treatment withgrowth hormone was then tested. It was found to increase the growth of thelength of bones (linear growth). Since short stature is an importantconsequence of pycnodysostosis, growth hormone treatment may prove veryuseful. ",
