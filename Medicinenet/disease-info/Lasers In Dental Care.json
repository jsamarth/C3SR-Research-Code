    "data": "  All lasers work by delivering energy in the form of light. When used forsurgical procedures, the laser acts as a cutting instrument or a vaporizer oftissue that it comes in contact with. When used for \"curing\" a filling,the laser helps to strengthen the bond between the filling and the tooth. Whenused in teeth whitening procedures, the laser acts as a heat source andenhances the effect of tooth beaching agents. Pros Compared to the traditional dental drill, lasers: May cause less pain in some instances, therefore, reducing the need for anesthesiaMay reduce anxiety in patients uncomfortable with the use of the dental drillMinimize bleeding and swelling during soft tissue treatmentsMay preserve more healthy tooth during cavity removal Cons The disadvantages of lasers are that: Lasers can't be used on teeth with fillings already in place. Lasers can't be used in many commonly performed dental procedures. Forexample, lasers can't be used to fill cavities located between teeth, aroundold fillings, and large cavities that need to be prepared for a crown. Inaddition, lasers cannot be used to remove defective crowns or silver fillings,or prepare teeth for bridges. Traditional drills may still be needed to shape the filling, adjust the bite, and polish the filling even when a laser is used. Lasers do not eliminate the need for anesthesia. Laser treatment tends to be more expensive since the cost of the laser ismuch higher than a dental drill. Lasers can cost between $39,000 and $45,000compared to about $600 for a standard drill.
