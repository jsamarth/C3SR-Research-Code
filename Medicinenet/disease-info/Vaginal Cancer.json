    "data": "  Age and exposure to the drug DES (diethylstilbestrol) before birth affect a woman's risk of developing vaginal cancer. Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Risk factors for vaginal cancer include the following: Being aged 60 or older. Being exposed to DES while in the mother's womb. In the 1950s, the drug DES was given to some pregnant women to prevent miscarriage (premature birth of a fetus that cannot survive). Women who were exposed to DES before birth have an increased risk of developing vaginal cancer. Some of these women develop a rare form of cancer called clear cell adenocarcinoma. Having human papilloma virus (HPV) infection. Having a history of abnormal cells in the cervix or cervical cancer. Possible signs of vaginal cancer include pain or abnormal vaginal bleeding. Vaginal cancer often does not cause early symptoms and may be found during a routine Pap test. When symptoms occur they may be caused by vaginal cancer or by other conditions. A doctor should be consulted if any of the following problems occur: Bleeding or discharge not related to menstrual periods. Pain during sexual intercourse. Pain in the pelvic area. A lump in the vagina. Tests that examine the vagina and other organs in the pelvis are used to detect (find) and diagnose vaginal cancer. The following tests and procedures may be used: Physical exam and history: An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patient's health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken. Pelvic exam: An exam of the vagina, cervix, uterus, fallopian tubes, ovaries, and rectum. The doctor or nurse inserts one or two lubricated, gloved fingers of one hand into the vagina and places the other hand over the lower abdomen to feel the size, shape, and position of the uterus and ovaries. A speculum is also inserted into the vagina and the doctor or nurse looks at the vagina and cervix for signs of disease. A Pap test or Pap smear of the cervix is usually done. The doctor or nurse also inserts a lubricated, gloved finger into the rectum to feel for lumps or abnormal areas. Pap smear: A procedure to collect cells from the surface of the cervix and vagina. A piece of cotton, a brush, or a small wooden stick is used to gently scrape cells from the cervix and vagina. The cells are viewed under a microscope to find out if they are abnormal. This procedure is also called a Pap test. Biopsy: The removal of cells or tissues from the vagina and cervix so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer. If a Pap smear shows abnormal cells in the vagina, a biopsy may be done during a colposcopy. Colposcopy: A procedure in which a colposcope (a lighted, magnifying instrument) is used to check the vagina and cervix for abnormal areas. Tissue samples may be taken using a curette (spoon-shaped instrument) and checked under a microscope for signs of disease.  Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. The prognosis (chance of recovery) depends on the following: The stage of the cancer (whether it is in the vagina only or has spread to other areas). The size of the tumor. The grade of tumor cells (how different they are from normal cells). Where the cancer is within the vagina. Whether there are symptoms. The patient's age and general health. Whether the cancer has just been diagnosed or has recurred (come back). Treatment options depend on the following: The stage, size, and location of the cancer. Whether the tumor cells are squamous cell or adenocarcinoma. Whether the patient has a uterus or has had a hysterectomy. Whether the patient has had past radiation treatment to the pelvis. After vaginal cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the vagina or to other parts of the body. The process used to find out if cancer has spread within the vagina or to other parts of the body is called staging. The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease. It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment. The following procedures may be used in the staging process: Biopsy: A biopsy may be done to find out if cancer has spread to the cervix. A sample of tissue is cut from the cervix and viewed under a microscope. A biopsy that removes only a small amount of tissue is usually done in the doctor's office. A woman may need to go to a hospital for a cone biopsy (removal of a larger, cone-shaped piece of tissue from the cervix and cervical canal). A biopsy of the vulva may also be done to see if cancer has spread there. Chest X-ray: An X-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest. An X-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body. Cystoscopy: A procedure to look inside the bladder and urethra to check for abnormal areas. A cystoscope is inserted through the urethra into the bladder. A cystoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. It may also have a tool to remove tissue samples, which are checked under a microscope for signs of cancer. Ureteroscopy: A procedure to look inside the ureters to check for abnormal areas. A ureteroscope is inserted through the bladder and into the ureters. A ureteroscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. It may also have a tool to remove tissue to be checked under a microscope for signs of disease. A ureteroscopy and cystoscopy may be done during the same procedure. Proctoscopy: A procedure to look inside the rectum to check for abnormal areas. A proctoscope is inserted through the rectum. A proctoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. It may also have a tool to remove tissue to be checked under a microscope for signs of disease. CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an X-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography. MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI). PET scan: A small amount of radioactive sugar is injected into a vein. Cancer cells use sugar differently than normal cells. A series of pictures are then taken looking for radioactivity usually in conjunction with a CT scan to define the extent of the vaginal cancer. The following stages are used for vaginal cancer: In stage 0, squamous cell cancer is found in tissue lining the inside of the vagina. Stage 0 cancer is also called carcinoma in situ. In stage I, cancer is found only in the vagina. In stage II, cancer has spread from the vagina to the tissue around the vagina. In stage III, cancer has spread from the vagina to the lymph nodes in the pelvis or groin, or to the pelvis, or both. Stage IV is divided into stage IVA and stage IVB: Stage IVA: Cancer may have spread to lymph nodes in the pelvis or groin and has spread to one or both of the following areas:The lining of the bladder or rectum. Beyond the pelvis. Stage IVB: Cancer has spread to parts of the body that are not near the vagina, such as the lungs. Cancer may also have spread to distant lymph nodes. Recurrent vaginal cancer is cancer that has recurred (come back) after it has been treated. The cancer may come back in the vagina or in other parts of the body.  There are different types of treatment for patients with vaginal cancer. Different types of treatments are available for patients with vaginal cancer. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. Before starting treatment, patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about ongoing clinical trials is available from the NCI Web site. Choosing the most appropriate cancer treatment is a decision that ideally involves the patient, family, and health care team. Three types of standard treatment are used: Surgery is the most common treatment of vaginal cancer. The following surgical procedures may be used: Laser surgery: A surgical procedure that uses a laser beam (a narrow beam of intense light) as a knife to make bloodless cuts in tissue or to remove a surface lesion such as a tumor. Wide local excision: A surgical procedure that takes out the cancer and some of the healthy tissue around it. Vaginectomy: Surgery to remove all or part of the vagina. Total hysterectomy: Surgery to remove the uterus, including the cervix. If the uterus and cervix are taken out through the vagina, the operation is called a vaginal hysterectomy. If the uterus and cervix are taken out through a large incision (cut) in the abdomen, the operation is called a total abdominal hysterectomy. If the uterus and cervix are taken out through a small incision in the abdomen using a laparoscope, the operation is called a total laparoscopic hysterectomy. Lymphadenectomy: A surgical procedure in which lymph nodes are removed and checked under a microscope for signs of cancer. This procedure is also called lymph node dissection. If the cancer is in the upper vagina, the pelvic lymph nodes may be removed. If the cancer is in the lower vagina, lymph nodes in the groin may be removed. Pelvic exenteration: Surgery to remove the lower colon, rectum, and bladder. In women, the cervix, vagina, ovaries, and nearby lymph nodes are also removed. Artificial openings (stoma) are made for urine and stool to flow from the body into a collection bag. Skin grafting may follow surgery, to repair or reconstruct the vagina. Skin grafting is a surgical procedure in which skin is moved from one part of the body to another. A piece of healthy skin is taken from a part of the body that is usually hidden, such as the buttock or thigh, and used to repair or rebuild the area treated with surgery. Even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, some patients may be given radiation therapy after surgery to kill any hidden cancer cells that are left. Cancer cells are very small and the doctor is unable to see individual cells. Treatment given after the surgery, to increase the chances of a cure, is called adjuvant therapy. Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy X-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy. External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer. Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer. The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can affect cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the spinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. Topical chemotherapy for squamous cell vaginal cancer may be applied to the vagina in a cream or lotion. New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials. These include the following: Radiosensitizers are drugs that make tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy. Combining radiation therapy with radiosensitizers may kill more tumor cells. This summary section refers to specific treatments under study in clinical trials, but it may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about ongoing clinical trials is available from the NCI Web site.  Treatment of vaginal squamous cell carcinoma in situ may include the following: Wide local excision, with or without a skin graft. Partial or total vaginectomy, with or without a skin graft. Topical chemotherapy. Laser surgery. Internal radiation therapy. Treatment of stage I squamous cell vaginal cancer may include the following: Internal radiation therapy, with or without external radiation therapy to lymph nodes or large tumors. Wide local excision or vaginectomy with vaginal reconstruction. Radiation therapy may be given after the surgery. Vaginectomy and lymphadenectomy, with or without vaginal reconstruction. Radiation therapy may be given after the surgery. Treatment of stage I vaginal adenocarcinoma may include the following: Vaginectomy, hysterectomy, and lymphadenectomy. This may be followed by vaginal reconstruction and/or radiation therapy. Internal radiation therapy, with or without external radiation therapy to lymph nodes. A combination of therapies that may include wide local excision with or without lymphadenectomy and internal radiation therapy. Treatment of stage II vaginal cancer is the same for squamous cell cancer and adenocarcinoma. Treatment may include the following: Both internal and external radiation therapy to the vagina, with or without external radiation therapy to lymph nodes. Vaginectomy or pelvic exenteration, with or without radiation therapy. Stage III Vaginal Cancer Treatment of stage III vaginal cancer is the same for squamous cell cancer and adenocarcinoma. Treatment may include both internal and external radiation therapy, with or without surgery. Treatment of stage IVA vaginal cancer is the same for squamous cell cancer and adenocarcinoma. Treatment may include both internal and external radiation therapy, with or without surgery. Treatment of stage IVB vaginal cancer is the same for squamous cell cancer and adenocarcinoma. Treatment may include the following: Radiation therapy as palliative therapy, to relieve symptoms and improve the quality of life. Chemotherapy may also be given. A clinical trial of chemotherapy and/or radiosensitizers. This summary section refers to specific treatments under study in clinical trials, but it may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about ongoing clinical trials is available from the NCI Web site.  Treatment of recurrent vaginal cancer may include the following: Pelvic exenteration. Radiation therapy. Chemotherapy. A clinical trial of a new treatment. Information about ongoing clinical trials is available from the NCI Web site. For more information, U.
