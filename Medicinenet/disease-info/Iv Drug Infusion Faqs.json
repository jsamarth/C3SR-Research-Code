The treatment for many conditions relies on medications administered by IV infusion therapy. Below are a few helpful suggestions to help you create a pleasant and healing experience.

It may be necessary to make an appointment to review all of your questions. Learn about the infused medication. There are many places to obtain information about your medication. Discuss the medication(s) with your doctor. Pharmaceutical companies often provide information in the offices and on the Internet for patients and their families. There may also be medical books written about your medication or health condition. Visit the Infusion Center and meet the medical staff before your first infusion. Check with your healthcare practitioner or the staff at the infusion center for any pre-infusion instructions. Some examples may include: Drink plenty of water to be sure you are well hydrated. If you have a heart condition, kidney condition or any other health condition that prevents you from drinking large amounts of fluid, check with your healthcare practitioner for instructions on how to hydrate before your infusion procedure. Some infusions may require that you pre-medicate with medications such as acetaminophen (Tylenol). Check with the infusion staff regarding any pre-medications you need to take prior to your infusion, the dose, and the best time to take the medications. Wear comfortable loose fitting clothes. You will want to be comfortable, and most likely your vital signs will monitored (for example, blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate (breathing rate), or a cardiac monitor may be attached to your chest). Every infusion center is different, so check with yours in regard to what to expect. Wearing loose fitting clothes allows the medical staff to easily and properly monitor your vital signs. Consider wearing clothing with layers to allow for temperature control.

Having layers of clothing allows you the flexibility to easily control your comfort zone. Most infusion centers will provide blankets, pillows, water and coffee. Check to see what the center provides in case they do not offer something that will make you more comfortable. Do not wear any fragrance or perfume, other patients may be allergic.
